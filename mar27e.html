<h1>Streams in the Desert - March 27 🌵✨</h1>

<p><span class="verse">"I don't consider the sufferings of our present life worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us"</span> <span class="emoji">🙌</span> (Romans 8:18).</p>

<p>A <span class="highlight">remarkable</span> thing happened at a wedding in England recently. <span class="emoji">💒</span> A rich young man from an important family - who had been <span class="highlight">blind</span> since age 10 but still achieved great things - was marrying a beautiful bride he had never seen. <span class="emoji">👰‍♂️</span> Right before the wedding, he underwent special eye treatments. <span class="emoji">👁️‍🗨️</span></p>

<p>The big day arrived with many important guests: <span class="emoji">🎩</span> government leaders, military officers, church leaders, and scholars. The groom, still with bandaged eyes, went to the church. His doctor met them there. <span class="emoji">🏥</span></p>

<p>The bride walked in nervously with her elderly father. <span class="emoji">👨‍👧</span> Would her love finally see the face he only knew by touch? <span class="emoji">✋❤️</span></p>

<p>As she reached the front, she saw something amazing: <span class="emoji">😲</span> The doctor was removing the last bandage from her groom's eyes! <span class="emoji">👁️</span></p>

<p>The groom stepped forward unsteadily, like someone in a dream. <span class="emoji">👣</span> Colorful light fell on his face - but did he see it? <span class="emoji">🌈</span> <span class="highlight">YES!</span> In that moment, his face showed <span class="highlight">dignity and joy like never before</span> as he walked to his bride. <span class="emoji">🥹</span></p>

<p>"<span class="highlight">At last!</span>" she whispered. "<span class="highlight">At last!</span>" he replied solemnly. <span class="emoji">💞</span></p>

<p>This <span class="highlight">powerful moment</span> gives us just a small idea of what <span class="highlight">Heaven</span> will be like! <span class="emoji">✨</span> When we who have struggled through life's hardships finally <span class="highlight">see Jesus face to face</span>. <span class="emoji">✝️</span></p>

<p class="verse">Just waiting for You, Jesus <span class="emoji">⏳</span><br>
My Lord so true and precious <span class="emoji">❤️</span><br>
Longing for You, wondering when <span class="emoji">🤔</span><br>
You'll come take me home again <span class="emoji">🏠</span><br>
In everything I say and do <span class="emoji">🗣️</span><br>
I'm just waiting for You <span class="emoji">🙏</span></p>

<p class="verse">Then one glorious day, no more waiting <span class="emoji">🎉</span><br>
You'll come for me - I'll be celebrating! <span class="emoji">🥳</span><br>
I'll see You, hear Your voice so sweet <span class="emoji">🎶</span><br>
Be with You - my joy complete! <span class="emoji">😊</span><br>
This hope fills my heart through and through <span class="emoji">💓</span><br>
Keeps me waiting, Lord, for You! <span class="emoji">✝️</span></p>
