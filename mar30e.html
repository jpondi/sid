<h1>🔥 Walking in the Light of Your Own Fire – Streams in the Desert – March 30 🌵</h1>

<div class="verse">
    <p><em>"Look, all you who start your own fires, who surround yourselves with your own sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks you have made. This is what you will get from Me: you will lie down in sorrow."</em> (Isaiah 50:11) ✨</p>
</div>

<p>This is a <strong>serious warning</strong> ⚠️ for those who are in darkness but try to create their own light instead of trusting God. The verse describes people making their own fire and surrounding themselves with sparks. What does this mean? 🤔</p>

<p>It means when we're in <strong>dark times</strong> 🌑, we often try to <em>fix things ourselves</em> instead of waiting for God. We might:</p>
<ul>
    <li>🌱 Rely on our own understanding</li>
    <li>💬 Ask friends for advice first</li>
    <li>🧠 Trust only our logic</li>
    <li>🚀 Try quick fixes that aren't from God</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all <strong>fires we make ourselves</strong> 🔥 – temporary lights that will eventually fail. God might let us follow these sparks, but it will only lead to <strong>pain</strong> 😢 in the end.</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>💖 <strong>Dear friend</strong>, don't try to escape dark places unless God says it's time and shows you His way. Hard times teach us important lessons 📚. Getting out too soon might ruin what God is trying to do in you. Give the situation to Him. Be willing to stay in the dark 🌌 as long as you have Him with you.</p>

    <p>✋ <strong>Stop interfering with God's plans</strong>. When you touch His work, you might damage it. You can move clock hands ⏰, but you don't change the time. You can force a rosebud open 🌹, but you ruin the flower. Let God work! Hands off! 🙌 <em>"Your will, not mine."</em> – Stephen Merritt</p>

    <h3>🛤 HIS WAY 🛤</h3>
    <p>God said "Go" when I wanted to stay<br>
    (The woods were cool and fair) 🌳<br>
    I didn't understand why then<br>
    Till I saw a boulder crash again<br>
    Right where I would have been standing there. 💥</p>

    <p>God said "Stay" when I wanted to go;<br>
    <em>"Your will be done,"</em> I said. 🙏<br>
    At dawn they found along my way<br>
    (Where I would have walked that day)<br>
    A deadly snake – now lying dead. 🐍⚰️</p>

    <p>No more I ask to understand,<br>
    Though the path I cannot see 👀<br>
    I'll walk His way where He says go;<br>
    For though <em>I</em> don't know, <em>He</em> does know,<br>
    And He chooses safe paths for me. 🛡️</p>
