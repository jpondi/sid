    <h1>🌵 Streams in the Desert - April 22 🌊</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"He knows the way that I take" ✝️ (Job 23:10)</div>
        
        <p>Dear believer! What a <span class="highlight">wonderful promise</span>! Your path—maybe a difficult, confusing, or painful way—this road of testing and tears. <span class="highlight">"He knows it."</span> 🔥 The fiery furnace—He lit it. We have an <span class="highlight">all-powerful Guide</span> who knows and directs every step, whether to bitter Marah or refreshing Elim.</p>
        
        <p>🌑 The way seems dark, but God gives His people a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. The furnace burns hot—but we can trust the One who controls it. These fires aren't meant to destroy, but to purify. When the refining is done (not too soon, not too late), He brings us out <span class="highlight">shining like gold</span>.</p>
        
        <p>When God feels farthest away, He's often closest. "When my spirit was overwhelmed, then You knew my path." ✨ Do we know this brilliant Light—brighter than the sun—who visits us at dawn? His eyes full of love watch us all day, knowing every step we take.</p>
        
        <p>The cold world calls troubles "Providence"—"the will of Providence"—"the strokes of Providence." But what is Providence? Why replace our living, caring God with some empty idea? Why trade a personal, powerful Jehovah for a lifeless thought?</p>
        
        <p>Our trials would hurt less if we saw what Job saw (when all his hopes were crushed)—only God's hand at work. 👑 He saw God behind:
        <br>⚔️ The Sabeans' swords
        <br>⚡ The lightning
        <br>🌪 The raging storm
        <br>😶 The terrible silence of his empty home</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord!" 🙌 Seeing God in everything, Job's faith reached its peak when this once-great desert prince, sitting in ashes, could say: <span class="highlight">"Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him."</span>
