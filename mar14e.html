            God has hidden secrets that even the wise and clever cannot understand. 🙏 Don’t be afraid of these mysteries. Be okay with not knowing everything. Wait patiently. Soon, God will show you the treasures hidden in the darkness—the beautiful and glorious things you can’t see yet. 🌟 The mystery is just a veil covering God’s face. 👁️

            Don’t be scared to step into the dark cloud that’s coming over your life. 🌧️ <span class="highlight">God is in that cloud.</span> On the other side, there is brightness and glory. ✨ “Don’t be surprised by the hard times you’re going through. It’s not strange. Instead, be happy because you’re sharing in Christ’s sufferings.” 🙌 When you feel alone and forgotten, God is close. He’s in the dark cloud. Step into the darkness without fear. Under that covering, you’ll find God waiting for you. 🕊️

            <span class="highlight">“Do you have a cloud?</span> 🌧️<br>
            Something dark and scary?<br>
            A storm warning above you?<br>
            Something making the sky darker and darker?<br>
            Something you’re afraid will explode?<br>
            A cloud casting a long, deep shadow?<br>
            <span class="emphasize">God is coming in that cloud.</span> 🌩️
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Do you have a cloud?</span> 🌧️<br>
            It’s God’s chariot of victory. 🏆<br>
            He’s riding to you through the storm.<br>
            The storm is His robe, the lightning His armor. ⚡<br>
            The cloud is the veil hiding His bright face—too dazzling for you to see. 🌞<br>
            <span class="emphasize">God is coming in that cloud.</span> 🌩️

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Do you have a cloud?</span> 🌧️<br>
            A trial that feels too hard?<br>
            A dark temptation?<br>
            The loss of someone you love? 💔<br>
            A mist hiding what’s ahead?<br>
            A mystery that doesn’t make sense?<br>
            A cloud blocking the sun’s light?<br>
            <span class="emphasize">God is coming in that cloud.</span> 🌩️
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Do you have a cloud?</span> 🌧️<br>
            Sickness, old age, pain, or death?<br>
            These clouds will disappear when you take your last breath. 💨<br>
            Don’t fear the clouds over your life’s journey.<br>
            Even the darkest clouds will shine with gold at the end. 🌅<br>
            <span class="emphasize">GOD is coming in that cloud.</span> 🌩️

            Dr. C. stood on a high mountain peak, watching a storm below. 🏔️ An eagle flew up through the clouds, its wet feathers shining like diamonds in the sun. 💎 Without the storm, the eagle might have stayed in the valley. 🌄 Life’s sorrows push us closer to God. 🙏
