        <h1>🌵 Streams in the Desert - April 11 🌵</h1>
        
        <div class="verse">"What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light" (Matthew 10:27).</div>
        
        <p>🙏 <span class="highlight">Jesus often brings us into dark places to share special truths with us.</span> He takes us:</p>
        <p>• 🌑 Into the shadow of grief when we lose someone dear</p>
        <p>• 🚪 Into loneliness when sickness keeps us from normal life</p>
        <p>• 💔 Into sadness when our dreams get broken</p>
        
        <p>✨ <span class="emphasis">In these dark places, He shares His wonderful secrets with us.</span> Our eyes, blinded by life's bright lights, begin to see heavenly truths. Our ears, deafened by the world's noise, start to hear God's quiet voice.</p>
        
        <p>⚖️ <span class="highlight">But these special messages come with responsibility</span> - we must <span class="emphasis">"speak in the light"</span> and <span class="emphasis">"proclaim from the rooftops."</span></p>
        
        <p>🌤️ We're not meant to stay in the dark forever. When God calls us back to busy life, we must share what we've learned.</p>
        
        <p>💡 <span class="highlight">This gives new meaning to hard times.</span> Often the worst part of suffering is feeling useless: <span class="emphasis">"I'm not helping anyone!" "Why is my life being wasted?"</span></p>
        
        <p>🌄 <span class="emphasis">But God has a purpose.</span> He takes us to higher places to meet with Him face-to-face, so we can bring His message to others below.</p>
        
        <p>⛰️ <span class="highlight">Was Moses' 40 days on the mountain wasted? Or Elijah's time at Horeb? Or Paul's years in Arabia?</span></p>
        
        <p>🛐 <span class="emphasis">There are no shortcuts to a faith-filled life.</span> We need quiet times alone with God - moments on mountaintops, rest in valleys, nights under stars when the world is quiet and we can see eternal things clearly.</p>
        
        <p>💞 <span class="highlight">Only then can we truly know God's constant presence</span> and say with the Psalmist: <span class="emphasis">"You are near, O God."</span></p>
        
        <div class="footer">
            <p>— F. B. Meyer</p>
            <p>🌸 <span class="emphasis">"Some hearts, like evening primroses, open more beautifully in the shadows of life."</span> 🌸</p>
