<p><em>I am handing over to you every place you set foot, as I promised Moses.</em> (Josh 1:3)

</p>

<p>Beside the literal ground, unoccupied for Christ, there is the unclaimed, untrodden territory of Divine promises. What did God say to Joshua? “Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you,” and then He draws the outlines of the Land of Promise—all theirs on one condition: that they shall march through the length and breadth of it, and measure it off with their own feet.

</p>

<p>They never did that to more than one-third of the property, and consequently they never had more than one-third; they had just what they measured off, and no more.

</p>

<p>In 2 Peter, we read of the “land of promise” that is opened up to us, and it is God’s will that we should, as it were, measure off that territory by the feet of obedient faith and believing obedience, thus claiming and appropriating it for our own.

</p>

<p>How many of us have ever taken possession of the promises of God in the name of Christ?

</p>

<p>Here is a magnificent territory for faith to lay hold on and march through the length and breadth of, and faith has never done it yet.

</p>

<p>Let us enter into all our inheritance. Let us lift up our eyes to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west, and hear Him say, “All the land that thou seest will I give to thee.”<br/> —<em>A. T. Pierson</em>

</p>

<p>Wherever Judah should set his foot that should be his; wherever Benjamin should set his foot, that should be his. Each should get his inheritance by setting his foot upon it. Now, think you not, when either had set his foot upon a given territory, he did not instantly and instinctively feel, “This is mine”?

<p>An old colored man, who had a marvelous experience in grace, was asked: “Daniel, why is it that you have so much peace and joy in religion?” “O Massa!” he replied, “I just fall flat on the exceeding great and precious promises, and I have all that is in them. Glory! Glory!” He who falls flat on the promises feels that all the riches embraced in them are his.<br/> —<em>Faith Papers</em>

<p>The Marquis of Salisbury was criticized for his Colonial policies and replied: “Gentlemen, get larger maps.”
