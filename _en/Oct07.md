<p><em>Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? He that walketh in darkness and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah and rely upon his God"</em> (Isa. 50:10, RV).

</p>

<p>What shall the believer do in times of darkness -- the darkness of perplexity and confusion, not of heart but of mind? Times of darkness come to the faithful and believing disciple who is walking obediently in the will of God; seasons when he does not know what to do, nor which way to turn. The sky is overcast with clouds. The clear light of Heaven does not shine upon his pathway. One feels as if he were groping his way in darkness.

</p>

<p>Beloved, is this you? What shall the believer do in times of darkness? Listen! "Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and rely upon his God." The first thing to do is do nothing. This is hard for poor human nature to do. In the West there is a saying that runs thus, "When you're rattled, don't rush"; in other words, "When you don't know what to do, don't do it." When you run into a spiritual fog bank, don't tear ahead; slow down the machinery of your life. If necessary, anchor your bark or let it swing at its moorings.

</p>

<p>We are to simply trust God. While we trust, God can work. Worry prevents Him from doing anything for us. If our minds are distracted and our hearts distressed; if the darkness that overshadows us strikes terror to us; if we run hither and yon in a vain effort to find some way of escape out of a dark place of trial, where Divine providence has put us, the Lord can do nothing for us.

</p>

<p>The peace of God must quiet our minds and rest our hearts. We must put our hand in the hand of God like a little child, and let Him lead us out into the bright sunshine of His love. He knows the way out of the woods. Let us climb up into His arms, and trust Him to take us out by the shortest and surest road.<br/> --Dr. Pardington

<p>Remember we are never without a pilot when we know not how to steer.

</p>

<p><em>"Hold on, my heart, in thy believing--<br/> The steadfast only wins the crown;<br/> He who, when stormy winds are heaving,<br/> Parts with its anchor, shall go down;</em>

</p>

<p><em>But he who Jesus holds through all,<br/> Shall stand, though Heaven and earth should fall.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Hold out! There comes an end to sorrow;<br/> Hope from the dust shall conquering rise;<br/> The storm foretells a summer's morrow;<br/> The Cross points on to Paradise;</em>

</p>

<p><em>The Father reigneth! cease all doubt;<br/> Hold on, my heart, hold on, hold out."</em>
