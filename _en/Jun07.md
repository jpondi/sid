<p><em>But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Creator, who gives songs in the night'</em> (Job 35:10)

</p>

<p>Do you have sleepless nights, tossing on the hot pillow, and watching for the first glint of dawn? Ask the Divine Spirit to enable you to fix your thoughts on God your Maker, and believe that He can fill those lonely, dreary hours with song.

</p>

<p>Is yours the night of bereavement? Is it not often at such a time that God draws near, and assures the mourner that the Lord has need of the departed loved one, and called “the eager, earnest spirit to stand in the bright throng of the invisible, liberated, radiant, active, intent on some high mission”; and as the thought enters, is there not the beginning of a song?

</p>

<p>Is yours the night of discouragement and fancied or actual failure? No one understands you, your friends reproach; but your Maker draws nigh, and gives you a song—a song of hope, the song which is harmonious with the strong, deep music of His providence. Be ready to sing the songs that your Maker gives.<br/> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>“What then? Shall we sit idly down and say </em><br/> <em>The night hath come; it is no longer day? </em><br/> <em>Yet as the evening twilight fades away, </em><br/> <em>The sky is filled with stars, invisible to day.</em>”

</p>

<p>The strength of the vessel can be demonstrated only by the hurricane, and the power of the Gospel can be fully shown only when the Christian is subjected to some fiery trial. If God would make manifest the fact that “He giveth songs in the night,” He must first make it night.<br/> <em>—William Taylor</em>
