<p><em>Now after some days, when he returned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home.</em> (Mark 2:1)

</p>

<p>The polyps which construct the coral reefs, work away under water, never dreaming that they are building the foundation of a new island on which, by-and-by, plants and animals will live and children of God be born and fitted for eternal glory as joint-heirs of Christ.

</p>

<p>If your place in God’s ranks is a hidden and secluded one, beloved, do not murmur, do not complain, do not seek to get out of God’s will, if He has placed you there; for without the polyps, the coral reefs would never be built, and God needs some who are willing to be spiritual polyps, and work away out of sight of men, but sustained by the Holy Ghost and in full view of Heaven.

</p>

<p>The day will come when Jesus will give the rewards, and He makes no mistakes, although some people may wonder how you came to merit such a reward, as they had never heard of you before.<br/> <em>—Selected</em>

<p><em>Just where you stand in the conflict,<br/> There is your place.<br/> Just where you think you are useless,<br/> Hide not your face.<br/> God placed you there for a purpose,<br/> Whate’er it be;<br/> Think He has chosen you for it;<br/> Work loyally.<br/> Gird on your armor! Be faithful<br/> At toil or rest!<br/> Whate’er it be, never doubting<br/> God’s way is best.<br/> Out in the fight or on picket,<br/> Stand firm and true;<br/> This is the work which your Master<br/> Gives you to do.</em><br/> —Selected

</p>

<p>The inspiring mountain top, the helpful fellowship of “just men,” and betake ourselves to our dim homely Emmaus, or to our dread public Colossae, or even to our far Macedonia in the mission field, quietly confident that just where He has placed us, in the usual round of life, He ordains that the borderland may be possessed, the victory won.<br/> <em>—Northcote Deck</em>
