<p><br/> <em>But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that you experience in your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer. And our hope for you is steadfast because we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort. </em>—2 Cor 1:6-7

</p>

<p>Are there not some in your circle to whom you naturally betake yourself in times of trial and sorrow? They always seem to speak the right word, to give the very counsel you are longing for; you do not realize, however, the cost which they had to pay ere they became so skillful in binding up the gaping wounds and drying tears. But if you were to investigate their past history you would find that they have suffered more than most. They have watched the slow untwisting of some silver cord on which the lamp of life hung. They have seen the golden bowl of joy dashed to their feet, and its contents spilt. They have stood by ebbing tides, and drooping gourds, and noon sunsets; but all this has been necessary to make them the nurses, the physicians, the priests of men. The boxes that come from foreign climes are clumsy enough; but they contain spices which scent the air with the fragrance of the Orient. So suffering is rough and hard to bear; but it hides beneath it discipline, education, possibilities, which not only leave us nobler, but perfect us to help others. Do not fret, or set your teeth, or wait doggedly for the suffering to pass; but get out of it all you can, both for yourself and for your service to your generation, according to the will of God.<br/> —Selected

<p>Once I heard a song of sweetness,<br/> As it cleft the morning air,<br/> Sounding in its blest completeness,<br/> Like a tender, pleading prayer;<br/> And I sought to find the singer,<br/> Whence the wondrous song was borne;<br/> And I found a bird, sore wounded,<br/> Pinioned by a cruel thorn.

</p>

<p>I have seen a soul in sadness,<br/> While its wings with pain were furl’d,<br/> Giving hope, and cheer and gladness<br/> That should bless a weeping world;<br/> And I knew that life of sweetness,<br/> Was of pain and sorrow row borne,<br/> And a stricken soul was singing,<br/> With its heart against a thorn.

</p>

<p>Ye are told of One who loved you,<br/> Of a Saviour crucified,<br/> Ye are told of nails that pinioned,<br/> And a spear that pierced His side;<br/> Ye are told of cruel scourging,<br/> Of a Saviour bearing scorn,<br/> And He died for your salvation,<br/> With His brow against a thorn.

</p>

<p>Ye “are not above the Master.”<br/> Will you breathe a sweet refrain?<br/> And His grace will be sufficient,<br/> When your heart is pierced with pain.<br/> Will you live to bless His loved ones,<br/> Tho’ your life be bruised and torn,<br/> Like the bird that sang so sweetly,<br/> With its heart against a thorn?<br/> —Selected
