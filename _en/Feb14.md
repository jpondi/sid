<p><em>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!</em> (Philippians 4:4).

</p>

<p>It is a good thing to "rejoice in the Lord." Perhaps you have tried it but seemed to fail at first. Don't give it a second thought, and forge ahead. Even when you cannot <em>feel</em> any joy, there is no spring in your step, nor any comfort or encouragement in your life, continue to rejoice and "consider it pure joy" (James 1:2). "Whenever you face trials of many kinds" (James 1:2), regard it as joy, delight in it, and God will reward your faith. Do you believe that your heavenly Father will let you carry the banner of His victory and joy to the very front of the battle, only to calmly withdraw to see you captured or beaten back by the enemy? NEVER! His Holy Spirit will sustain you in your bold advance and fill your heart with gladness and praise. You will find that your heart is exhilarated and refreshed by the fullness within.

</p>

<p>Lord, teach me to rejoice in You - to "be joyful always" (1 Thess. 5:16).<br/><em>--selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>The weakest saint may Satan rout,<br/> Who meets him with a praiseful shout.</em>

</p>

<p>Be filled with the Spirit... Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord.<br/>--Ephesians 5:18-19

</p>

<p>In these verses, the apostle Paul urges us to use singing as inspiration in our spiritual life. He warns his readers to seek motivation not through the body but through the spirit, not by stimulating the flesh but by exalting the soul.

</p>

<p><em>Sometimes a light surprises<br/> The Christian while he sings.</em>

</p>

<p>Let us sing even when we do not feel like it, for in this way we give wings to heavy feet and turn weariness into strength.<br/><em>--John Henry Jowett</em>

</p>

<p>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.<br/>--Acts 16:25

</p>

<p>O Paul, what a wonderful example you are to us! You gloried in the fact that you "bear on [your] body the marks of Jesus" (Gal. 6:17). You bore the marks from nearly being stoned to death, from three times being "beaten with rods" (2 Cor. 11:25), from receiving 195 lashes from the Jews, and from being bloodily beaten in the Philippian jail. Surely the grace that enabled you to sing praises while enduring such suffering is sufficient for us.<br/><em>--J. Roach</em>

</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Oh, let us rejoice in the Lord, evermore,<br/> When darts of the Tempter are flying,<br/> For Satan still dreads, as he oft did before,<br/> Our singing much more than our crying.</em>
