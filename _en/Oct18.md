<p><br/> <em>"Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs; . . . they shall afflict them four hundred years; . . . and afterward they shall come out with great substance"</em> (Genesis 5:12-14).

</p>

<p>An assured part of God's pledged blessing to us is delay and suffering. A delay in Abram's own lifetime that seemed to put God's pledge beyond fulfillment was followed by seemingly unendurable delay of Abram's descendants. But it was only a delay: they "came out with great substance." The pledge was redeemed.

</p>

<p>God is going to test me with delays; and with the delays will come suffering, but through it all stands God's pledge: His new covenant with me in Christ, and His inviolable promise of every lesser blessing that I need. The delay and the suffering are part of the promised blessing; let me praise Him for them today; and let me wait on the Lord and be of good courage and He will strengthen my heart.<br/> <em>--C. G. Trumbull</em>

<p><em>Unanswered yet the prayer your lips have pleaded<br/> In agony of heart these many years?<br/> Does faith begin to fail? Is hope departing?<br/> And think you all in vain those falling tears?<br/> Say not the Father hath not heard your prayer;<br/> You shall have your desire sometime, somewhere.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Unanswered yet? Nay do not say ungranted;<br/> Perhaps your work is not yet wholly done.<br/> The work began when first your prayer was uttered,<br/> And God will finish what He has begun.<br/> If you will keep the incense burning there,<br/> His glory you shall see sometime, somewhere.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Unanswered yet? Faith cannot be unanswered,<br/> Her feet are firmly planted on the Rock;<br/> Amid the wildest storms she stands undaunted,<br/> Nor quails before the loudest thunder shock.<br/> She knows Omnipotence has heard her prayer,<br/> And cries, "It shall be done"--sometime, somewhere.</em><br/> --Miss Ophelia G. Browning
