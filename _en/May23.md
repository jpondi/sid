<p><em>At their wit's end, they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out" </em>(Ps. 107:27, 28).

</p>

<p><em>Are you standing at "Wit's End Corner,"</em><br/> <em><em>Christian, with troubled brow?</em><br/> <em>Are you thinking of what is before you,</em><br/> <em>And all you are bearing now?</em><br/> <em>Does all the world seem against you,</em><br/> <em>And you in the battle alone?</em><br/> <em>Remember--at "Wit's End Corner"</em><br/> <em>Is just where God's power is shown.</em><br/> <em>Are you standing at "Wit's End Corner,"</em><br/> <em>Blinded with wearying pain,</em><br/> <em>Feeling you cannot endure it,</em><br/> <em>You cannot bear the strain,</em><br/> <em>Bruised through the constant suffering,</em><br/> <em>Dizzy, and dazed, and numb?</em><br/> <em>Remember--at "Wit's End Corner"</em><br/> <em>Is where Jesus loves to come.</em><br/> <em>Are you standing at "Wit's End Corner"?</em><br/> <em>Your work before you spread,</em><br/> <em>All lying begun, unfinished,</em><br/> <em>And pressing on heart and head,</em><br/> <em>Longing for strength to do it,</em><br/> <em>Stretching out trembling hands?</em><br/> <em>Remember--at. "Wit's End Corner"</em><br/> <em>The Burden-bearer stands.</em><br/> <em>Are you standing at "Wit's End Corner"?</em><br/> <em>Then you're just in the very spot</em><br/> <em>To learn the wondrous resources</em><br/> <em>Of Him who faileth not:</em><br/> <em>No doubt to a brighter pathway</em><br/> <em>Your footsteps will soon be moved,</em><br/> <em>But only at "Wit's End Corner"</em></em><br/> <em>Is the "God who is able" proved.</em><br/> --Antoinette Wilson
