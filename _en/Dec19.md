<p><em>This will be a time for you to serve as witnesses.</em> —Luke 21:13

</p>

<p>Life is a steep climb, and it does the heart good to have somebody “call back” and cheerily beckon us on up the high hill. We are all climbers together, and we must help one another. This mountain climbing is serious business, but glorious. It takes strength and steady step to find the summits. The outlook widens with the altitude. If anyone among us has found anything worth while, we ought to “call back.”

</p>

<p>If you have gone a little way ahead of me, call back—<br/> ’Twill cheer my heart and help my feet along the stony track;<br/> And if, perchance, Faith’s light is dim, because the oil is low,<br/> Your call will guide my lagging course as wearily I go.

</p>

<p>Call back, and tell me that He went with you into the storm;<br/> Call back, and say He kept you when the forest’s roots were torn;<br/> That, when the heavens thunder and the earthquake shook the hill,<br/> He bore you up and held you where the very air was still.

</p>

<p>Oh, friend, call back, and tell me for I cannot see your your face,<br/> They say it glows with triumph, and your feet bound in the race;<br/> But there are mists between us and my spirit eyes are dim,<br/> And I cannot see the glory, though I long for word of Him.

</p>

<p>But if you’ll say He heard you when your prayer was but a cry,<br/> And if you’ll say He saw you through the night’s sin-darkened sky<br/> If you have gone a little way ahead, oh, friend, call back—<br/> ’Twill cheer my heart and help my feet along the stony track.<br/> —<em>Selected</em>
