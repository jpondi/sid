<p><br/> <em>"The exception is Caleb son of Jephunneh; he will see it and I will give him and his descendants the territory on which he has walked, because he has wholeheartedly followed me.</em>”—Deut 1:36

</p>

<p>Every hard duty that lies in your path, that you would rather not do, that it will cost you pain and struggle or sore effort to do, has a blessing in it. Not to do it, at whatever cost, is to miss the blessing.

</p>

<p>Every hard piece of road on which you see the Master’s shoe-prints and along which He bids you follow Him, surely leads to blessing, which you cannot get if you cannot go over the steep, thorny path.

</p>

<p>Every point of battle to which you come, where you must draw your sword and fight the enemy, has a possible victory which will prove a rich blessing to your life. Every heavy load that you are called to lift hides in itself some strange secret of strength.<br/> <em>—J. R. Miller</em>

</p>

<p><em>“I cannot do it alone;<br/> The waves run fast and high,<br/> And the fogs close all around,<br/> The light goes out in the sky;<br/> But I know that we two<br/> Shall win in the end, Jesus and I.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Coward and wayward and weak,<br/> I change with the changing sky;<br/> Today so eager and bright,<br/> Tomorrow too weak to try;<br/> But He never gives in,<br/> So we two shall win, Jesus and I.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“I could not guide it myself,<br/> My boat on life’s wild sea;<br/> There’s One who sits by my side,<br/> Who pulls and steers with me.<br/> And I know that we two<br/> Shall safe enter port,<br/> Jesus and I.”</em>
