<p><em>I will give myself unto prayer</em> (Ps. 109:4).

</p>

<p>We are often in a religious hurry in our devotions. How much time do we spend in them daily? Can it not be easily reckoned in minutes? Who ever knew an eminently holy man who did not spend much of his time in prayer? Did ever a man exhibit much of the spirit of prayer, who did not devote much time in his closet?

</p>

<p>Whitefield says, "Whole days and weeks have I spent prostrate on the ground, in silent or vocal prayer." "Fall upon your knees and grow there," is the language of another, who knew whereof he affirmed.

</p>

<p>It has been said that no great work in literature or science was ever wrought by a man who did not love solitude. We may lay it down as an elemental principle of religion, that no large growth in holiness was ever gained by one who did not take time to be often, and long, alone with God.<br/> <em>--The Still Hour</em>

</p>

<p><em>'Come, come,' He saith, 'O soul oppressed and weary,<br/> Come to the shadows of my desert rest;<br/> Come walk with Me far from life's babbling discords,<br/> And peace shall breathe like music in thy breast.'</em>

</p>
