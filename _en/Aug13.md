<p><em>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth</em>. Ecclesiastes 11:3

</p>

<p>Why, then, do we dread the clouds which now darken our sky? True, for a while they hide the sun, but the sun is not quenched; he will be out again before long. Meanwhile those black clouds are filled with rain; and the blacker they are, the more likely they will yield plentiful showers.

</p>

<p>How can we have rain without clouds? Our troubles have always brought us blessings, and they always will. They are the dark chariots of bright grace. These clouds will empty themselves before long, and every tender herb will be gladder for the shower. Our God may drench us with grief, but He will refresh us with mercy. Our Lord's love-letters often come to us in black-edged envelopes. His wagons rumble, but they are loaded with benefits. His rod blossoms with sweet flowers and nourishing fruits. Let us not worry about the clouds, but sing because May flowers are brought to us through the April clouds and showers.

</p>

<p>O Lord, the clouds are the dust of Thy feet! How near Thou art in the cloudy and dark day! Love beholds Thee, and is glad. Faith sees the clouds emptying themselves and making the little hills rejoice on every side.<br/> <em>--C H. Spurgeon</em>

</p>

<p><em>What seems so dark to thy dim sight<br/> May be a shadow, seen aright<br/> Making some brightness doubly bright.<br/> The flash that struck thy tree--no more<br/> To shelter thee--lets heaven's blue floor<br/> Shine where it never shone before.<br/> The cry wrung from thy spirit's pain<br/> May echo on some far-off plain,<br/> And guide a wanderer home again.</em>

</p>

<p>"The blue of heaven is larger than the clouds."
