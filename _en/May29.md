<p><em>I no longer call you slaves, because the slave does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have revealed to you everything I heard from my Father</em>. (John 15:15)

</p>

<p>Years ago there was an old German professor whose beautiful life was a marvel to his students. Some of them resolved to know the secret of it; so one of their number hid in the study where the old professor spent his evenings.

</p>

<p>It was late when the teacher came in. He was very tired, but he sat down and spent an hour with his Bible. Then he bowed his head in secret prayer; and finally closing the Book of books, he said,

</p>

<p>“Well, Lord Jesus, we’re on the same old terms.”

</p>

<p>To know Him is life’s highest attainment; and at all costs, every Christian should strive to be “on the same old terms with Him.”

</p>

<p>The reality of Jesus comes as a result of secret prayer, and a personal study of the Bible that is devotional and sympathetic. Christ becomes more real to the one who persists in the cultivation of His presence.

</p>

<p><em>Speak thou to Him for He heareth,</em><br/> <em><em>And spirit with spirit will meet!</em><br/> <em>Nearer is He than breathing,</em><br/> <em>Nearer than hands and feet.</em></em><br/> —Maltbie D. Babcock
