<p class="p1"><i>Joseph’s master took him and threw him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. So he was there in the prison. But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him kindness. He granted him favor in the sight of the prison warden. The warden put all the prisoners under Joseph’s care. He was in charge of whatever they were doing. The warden did not concern himself with anything that was in Joseph’s care because the Lord was with him and whatever he was doing the Lord was making successful</i>. (Gen 39:20-23)

</p>

<p class="p1">When God lets us go to prison because we have been serving Him, and goes there with us, prison is about the most blessed place in the world that we could be in. Joseph seems to have known that. He did not sulk and grow discouraged and rebellious because “everything was against him.” If he had, the prison-keeper would never have trusted him so. Joseph does not even seem to have pitied himself.

</p>

<p class="p1">Let us remember that if self-pity is allowed to set in, that is the end of us—until it is cast utterly from us. Joseph just turned over everything in joyous trust to God, and so the keeper of the prison turned over everything to Joseph. Lord Jesus, when the prison doors close in on me, keep me trusting, and keep my joy full and abounding. Prosper Thy work through me in prison: even there, make me free indeed.<br/> <em>—Selected</em>

<p class="p1"><em>A little bird I am,<br/> Shut from the fields of air,<br/> And in my cage I sit and sing<br/> To Him who placed me there;<br/> Well pleased a prisoner to be,<br/> Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.</em>

</p>

<p class="p1"><em>My cage confines me round,<br/> Abroad I cannot fly,<br/> But though my wing is closely bound,<br/> My soul is at liberty;<br/> For prison walls cannot control<br/> The flight, the freedom of the soul.</em>
