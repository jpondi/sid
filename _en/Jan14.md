<p><em>He putteth forth his own sheep (</em>John 10:4<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>Oh, this is bitter work for Him and us -- bitter for us to go, but equally bitter for Him to cause us pain; yet it must be done. It would not be conducive to our true welfare to stay always in one happy and comfortable lot. He therefore puts us forth. The fold is deserted, that the sheep may wander over the bracing mountain slope. The laborers must be thrust out into the harvest, else the golden grain would spoil.

</p>

<p>Take heart! it could not be better to stay when He determines otherwise; and if the loving hand of our Lord puts us forth, it must be well. On, in His name, to green pastures and still waters and mountain heights! He goeth before thee. Whatever awaits us is encountered first by Him. Faith's eye can always discern His majestic presence in front; and when that cannot be seen, it is dangerous to move forward. Bind this comfort to your heart, that the Savior has tried for Himself all the experiences through which He asks you to pass; and He would not ask you to pass through them unless He was sure that they were not too difficult for your feet, or too trying for your strength.

</p>

<p>This is the Blessed Life -- not anxious to see far in front, nor careful about the next step, not eager to choose the path, nor weighted with the heavy responsibilities of the future, but quietly following behind the Shepherd, one step at a time.

</p>

<p><em>Dark is the sky! and veiled the unknown morrow<br/> Dark is life's way, for night is not yet o'er;<br/> The longed-for glimpse I may not meanwhile borrow;<br/> But, this I know, HE GOETH ON BEFORE.<br/> Dangers are nigh! and fears my mind are shaking;<br/> Heart seems to dread what life may hold in store;<br/> But I am His--He knows the way I'm taking,<br/> More blessed still--HE GOETH ON BEFORE.<br/> Doubts cast their weird, unwelcome shadows o'er me,<br/> Doubts that life's best--life's choicest things are o'er;<br/> What but His Word can strengthen, can restore me,<br/> And this blest fact; that still HE GOES BEFORE.<br/> HE GOES BEFORE! Be this my consolation!<br/> He goes before! On this my heart would dwell!<br/> He goes before! This guarantees salvation!<br/> HE GOES BEFORE! And therefore all is well. </em><br/> --J. D. Smith

</p>

<p>The Oriental shepherd was always ahead of his sheep. He was down in front. Any attack upon them had to take him into account. Now God is down in front. He is in the tomorrows. It is tomorrow that fills men with dread. God is there already. All the tomorrows of our life have to pass Him before they can get to us.<br/> <em>--F. B. M.</em>

</p>

<p><em>God is in every tomorrow,<br/> Therefore I live for today,<br/> Certain of finding at sunrise,<br/> Guidance and strength for the way;<br/> Power for each moment of weakness,<br/> Hope for each moment of pain,<br/> Comfort for every sorrow,<br/> Sunshine and joy after rain.</em>
