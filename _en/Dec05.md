<p><br/> <em>O Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps</em> (Jeremiah 10:23).

</p>

<p><em>Lead me in a plain path</em> (Psalms 27:11).

</p>

<p>Many people want to direct God, instead of resigning themselves to be directed by Him; to show Him a way, instead of passively following where He leads.<br/> <em>--Madame Guyon</em>

<p><em>I said: "Let me walk in the field";<br/> God said: 'Nay, walk in the town";<br/> I said: "There are no flowers there";<br/> He said: "No flowers, but a crown."<br/> I said: "But the sky is black,<br/> There is nothing but noise and din";<br/> But He wept as He sent me back,<br/> "There is more," He said, "there is sin<br/> I said: "But the air is thick,<br/> And fogs are veiling the sun";<br/> He answered: "Yet souls are sick,<br/> And souls in the dark undone."<br/> I said: "I shall miss the light,<br/> And friends will miss me, they say";<br/> He answered me, "Choose tonight,<br/> If I am to miss you, or they."<br/> I pleaded for time to be given;<br/> He said: "Is it hard to decide?<br/> It will not seem hard in Heaven<br/> To have, followed the steps of your Guide."<br/> I cast one look at the fields,<br/> Then set my face to the town;<br/> He said: "My child, do you yield?<br/> Will you leave the flowers for the crown?"<br/> Then into His hand went mine,<br/> And into my heart came He;<br/> And I walk in a light Divine,</em><br/> <em>The path I had feared to see.</em><br/> --George MacDonald
