<p><em>A cup of cold water only</em>  (Matthew 10:42).

</p>

<p>What am I to do? I expect to pass through this world but once. Any good work, therefore, any kindness, or any service I can render to any soul of man or animal let me do it now. Let me not neglect or defer it, for I shall not pass this way again.<br/> <em> <em>--An Old Quaker Saying</em></em>

</p>

<p><em><em>It isn't the thing you do, dear,<br/> It's the thing you leave undone,<br/> Which gives you the bitter heartache<br/> At the setting of the sun;<br/> The tender word unspoken,<br/> The letter you did not write,<br/> The flower you might have sent, dear,<br/> Are your haunting ghosts at night.<br/> The stone you might have lifted<br/> Out of your brother's way,<br/> The bit of heartsome counsel<br/> You were hurried too much to say;<br/> The loving touch of the hand, dear,<br/> The gentle and winsome tone,<br/> That you had no time or thought for,<br/> With troubles enough of your own.<br/> These little acts of kindness,<br/> So easily out of mind,<br/> These chances to be angels,<br/> Which even mortals find<br/> They come in night and silence,<br/> Each chill reproachful wraith,<br/> When hope is faint and flagging,<br/> And a blight has dropped on faith.<br/> For life is all too short, dear.<br/> And sorrow is all too great,<br/> To suffer our slow compassion<br/> That tarries until too late.<br/> And it's not the thing you do, dear,<br/> It's the thing you leave undone,<br/> Which gives you the bitter heartache,</em><br/> <em>At the setting of the sun.</em><br/> </em>--Adelaide Proctor

<p>Give what you have; to someone it may be better than you dare to think.<br/> <em> <em>--Longfellow</em></em>
