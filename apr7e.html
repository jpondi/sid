            <em>🙌 "Their strength is to sit still."</em> (Isaiah 30:7) ✝️
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p>To truly know God, we <span class="highlight">must learn to be still inside</span>. 🤫 I remember when I first discovered this. There was a crisis in my life - my whole being was shaking with worry, and I felt I needed to act immediately. But I couldn't do anything, and the person who could help wouldn't move. 😔</p>
            
            <p>I felt like I might explode from all the chaos inside me. Then suddenly, <span class="highlight">God's quiet voice spoke to my heart</span>: "Be still, and know that I am God." 🕊️ Those words had power! I listened. I made my body completely still. I calmed my troubled heart. I looked up and waited. Then I truly <span class="highlight">knew</span> it was God - even in this emergency when I felt so helpless. And I rested in Him. 😌</p>
            
            <p>This was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything! 🌟 And from this stillness came the power to handle the situation, which was soon resolved successfully. That's when I truly learned that <span class="highlight">my strength comes from sitting still</span> in God. 🙏</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>There's a special kind of <span class="highlight">quiet waiting that isn't laziness</span>. It's a living stillness that grows from trust. 😇 Nervous tension isn't trust - it's just worry packed tight. ✨</p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>🌪️ Not in the wild storm's crashing sound,<br>
            🌋 Not in earthquakes or fires all around;<br>
            🤫 But in the quiet that removes all fear,<br>
            🗣️ God's soft whisper to Elijah came clear.</p>
            
            <p>⛰️ O Soul, be silent on God's high place,<br>
            🌊 Though needs pound like waves in your face;<br>
            🙏 From hurried prayers and restless plea,<br>
            🧘 Be still - hear what God says to thee.</p>
            
            <p>🕊️ All true fellowship needs times of rest,<br>
            💪 New strength grows when we pause our quest;<br>
            🎶 The sweetest songs of heaven's choir,<br>
            🤫 Are silent for half an hour entire.</p>
            
            <p>😌 O rest, in complete soul-quietude,<br>
            🤐 Leave words, pause prayer and gratitude;<br>
            👐 Let your whole being, in His control,<br>
            😊 Learn the full meaning of His voice and soul.</p>
            
            <p>🥊 Not like athletes fighting for gold,<br>
            ⛑️ Not taking heaven by force so bold;<br>
            👶 But as a child with Father dear,<br>
            🤫 Sit down - know joy when you "Be Still" hear.</p>
