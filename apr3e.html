  <h1>🔥 <b>Streams in the Desert</b> - April 3 🔥</h1>
</div>

<div class="verse">
  <p>✨ <i>"Glorify ye the Lord in the fires"</i> (Isaiah 24:15). ✨</p>
</div>

<p>Notice the small but powerful word <span class="highlight">"in"</span>! 🙌 We are to honor God <span class="highlight">in</span> our trials—right in the middle of what truly hurts. 🔥 While sometimes God protects His people from feeling the pain, usually <span class="highlight">fire burns</span>.</p>

<p>But this is exactly where we <span class="highlight">glorify Him</span>—by showing complete trust in His goodness and love, even when hard things happen to us. 💖 And more than that, we believe that <span class="highlight">something greater</span> will come from this trial—something that brings Him more praise than if we hadn't gone through it. 🌱➡️🌻</p>

<p>Some fires are so hot that only <span class="highlight">strong faith</span> can walk through them—weak faith will fail. 🚶‍♂️🔥 We must <span class="highlight">win the victory while still in the furnace</span>. 🏆</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>🦁 <i>"A person shows their true faith during hard times. The men thrown into the fiery furnace came out exactly as they went in—except their chains were gone!"</i> ⛓️➡️✨</p>
</div>

<p>How often God uses our <span class="highlight">fires of trouble</span> to burn away what binds us! 🔥 Those three men weren't hurt at all—no burns, no singed hair, not even the smell of smoke on their clothes. 👕 That's how Christians should come through trials—<span class="highlight">free from what held them down</span>, but untouched by the flames. ✝️</p>

<div class="verse">
  <p>🌟 <i>"Triumphing over them in it"</i> (Colossians 2:15). 🌟</p>
</div>

<p>That's <span class="highlight">real victory</span>—winning <span class="highlight">while still in</span> the sickness, <span class="highlight">while still facing</span> death, <span class="highlight">while still surrounded</span> by problems. 💪 Oh, believe this: there's a power that makes us <span class="highlight">more than conquerors</span>! There are heights where we can look back at our journey and <span class="highlight">sing victory songs</span> even before reaching Heaven. 🎶 We can seem rich when poor, and make others rich through our poverty. Our triumph comes <span class="highlight">while still in the battle</span>. Christ's greatest triumph came in His suffering—maybe ours does too. ✝️</p>

<div class="quote">
  <p>💖 <i>"Isn't it amazing to see someone weighed down by troubles yet keeping a joyful heart? Or someone terribly tempted but still winning? Or a suffering traveler whose patience never breaks? This shows God's power at work!"</i> 🌈</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
  <p>🌊 <i>When all supports crumble away,<br>
  And life feels like a stormy sea,<br>
  Can you remain—through darkest day—<br>
  A miracle of peace, set free?</i> 🕊️</p>
</div>
