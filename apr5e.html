  <h1>🌿 God's Pattern - Streams in the Desert - April 5 🌿</h1>

  <p><span class="verse">"You must shut the door behind you and your sons"</span> <span class="emoji">(2 Kings 4:4) 🔒</span></p>

  <p>They needed to be <span class="highlight">alone with God</span> ✝️. This wasn't about normal ways of doing things, human help, or even religious systems. They had to <span class="highlight">step away from everything familiar</span> 🌌 and depend <span class="emoji">only on God</span> 🙏, connecting directly with the <span class="highlight">source of all miracles</span> ✨.</p>

  <p>This is part of <span class="highlight">God's plan</span> 📜 - a <span class="emoji">special place of being alone</span> � with Him in prayer and faith that every fruitful soul must experience.</p>

  <p>Sometimes God <span class="highlight">puts walls around us</span> 🧱, removes all our usual supports, and places us in <span class="emoji">completely new situations</span> 🆕 where only <span class="highlight">His divine power</span> ⚡ can work. He makes us <span class="highlight">stop relying on old patterns</span> 🧩 and <span class="emoji">trust only in Him</span> 🤲.</p>

  <p>Many believers live predictable lives ⏳, but those God calls to special purposes find themselves in places where they <span class="highlight">only know one thing</span>: <span class="emoji">God is holding them</span> 🤗 and working in ways they can't predict.</p>

  <div class="quote">
    <p>Like this widow, we must <span class="highlight">let go of outward things</span> 👐 and <span class="emoji">hold tightly to the Lord</span> ❤️ to see His amazing works. —Soul Food</p>

  <div class="quote">
    <p>In our <span class="highlight">hardest trials</span> 💔, God often reveals <span class="emoji">His sweetest comforts</span> 🍯. —Gems</p>

  <div class="quote">
    <p>"<span class="highlight">God sometimes closes the door and shuts us in</span> 🚪,<br>
    So He can speak, maybe through tears or pain 💧,<br>
    And quietly, heart to heart 💞 above life's noise,<br>
    He shares His precious thoughts with us again." 🗝️</p>
