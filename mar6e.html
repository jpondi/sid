    <h1 style="font-size: 22px; color: #4682b4; text-align: center;">🌿 Always Trusting - Streams in the Desert - March 6 🌟</h1>

    <p><strong>📖 “But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Not only this, but it is now the third day since these things happened”</strong> (<em>Luke 24:21</em>).</p>

    <p>😔 I have always felt so sorry that on their walk to Emmaus, the disciples didn’t say to Jesus, <strong>“We still trust”</strong>. Instead, they said, <strong>“We trusted.”</strong> 💔 It’s so sad—it feels like their faith was completely gone. 😞</p>

    <p>If only they had said, <em>“Everything is against our hope; it looks like our trust is in vain, but we won’t give up. We believe we’ll see Him again.”</em> 🙏✨ But no—they walked beside Him, talking about their lost faith. 😢 This made Him say, <strong>“O fools, and slow of heart to believe!”</strong> 💡</p>

    <p>⚠️ Are we not in the same danger of hearing these words said to us? 🤔 Let’s remember: we can afford to lose anything and everything, but we can’t afford to lose our faith in the God of truth and love. ❤️🔥</p>

    <p>💡 <strong>Let’s never put our faith in the past tense—</strong> <em>“We trusted.”</em> ❌ Instead, let us boldly say, <strong>“I am trusting.”</strong> ✅💪</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 22px; color: #6a5acd;">🌈🕊️ A Gentle Reminder:</h2>

        🌞 The soft, sweet summer was warm and glowing,<br>
        🌸 Bright were the blossoms on every bough:<br>
        🌹 I trusted Him when the roses were blooming;<br>
        💖 I trust Him now…<br><br>
        ☁️ Small were my faith should it weakly falter<br>
        🍂 Now that the roses have ceased to blow; <br>
        🌧️ Frail were the trust that now should alter,<br>
        ⚡ Doubting His love when storm clouds grow. ⛈️<br>
        —<em>The Song of a Bird in a Winter Storm</em> 🐦❄️

    <p style="text-align: center;">💖✨ Let’s keep trusting, no matter the season! 🌟🙌</p>
