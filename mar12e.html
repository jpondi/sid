<h1>🌪️ Streams in the Desert - March 12 🌪️</h1>

<p>So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the Lord sent an <span class="highlight">east wind</span> that blew all day and all night. By morning, the wind had brought <span class="emphasize">locusts</span>! Then the Lord sent a <span class="highlight">strong west wind</span>, which lifted the locusts and blew them into the <span class="emphasize">Red Sea</span>. Not a single locust was left in Egypt. (<span class="emphasize">Exodus 10:13,19</span>)</p>

<p>In ancient times, when the Lord fought for Israel against cruel Pharaoh, <span class="highlight">stormy winds</span> brought their deliverance. It seemed harsh—Israel was trapped between the wild sea, rocky cliffs, and a gathering storm. They cried, “The Egyptians are coming!” 🏞️🌊</p>

<p>But just when all hope seemed lost, the <span class="highlight">stormy wind</span> pushed back the waves, and Israel marched through the sea on dry ground. 🌬️✨ The sea walls glowed with God’s glory, and the storm thundered above. By dawn, all of Israel had crossed safely. 🕊️</p>

<p>Then Israel sang a song of praise: <span class="emphasize">“The stormy wind fulfills His word.”</span> 🎶</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>“The enemy said, ‘I will chase, I will catch, I will take the plunder…’ But You blew with Your wind, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.”</p>
</div>

<p>One day, by God’s mercy, we will stand on the <span class="emphasize">sea of glass</span> 🎨, holding harps, and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb: <span class="emphasize">“Your ways are just and true, King of saints.”</span> We’ll see how the <span class="highlight">stormy winds</span> brought our deliverance. 🌈</p>

<p>Now, you only see the mystery of sorrow. Later, you’ll see how the enemy was swept away in the storm. 🌪️ Now, you see only loss. Later, you’ll see how it broke the chains of evil. 🔗 Now, you fear the howling winds and thunder. Later, you’ll see how they cleared your path to the <span class="emphasize">Promised Land</span>. 🌄</p>

<p class="quote">“Though winds are wild,<br>
And the gale unleashed,<br>
My trusting heart still sings:<br>
I know they mean no harm to me,<br>
He rides on their wings.” 🕊️🌬️</p>
