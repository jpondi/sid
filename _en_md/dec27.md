<p><em>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him</em> (Ps. 25:14).

</p>

<p>There are secrets of Providence which God's dear children may learn. His dealings with them often seem, to the outward eye, dark and terrible. Faith looks deeper and says, "This is God's secret. You look only on the outside; I can look deeper and see the hidden meaning."

</p>

<p>Sometimes diamonds are done up in rough packages, so that their value cannot be seen. When the Tabernacle was built in the wilderness there was nothing rich in its outside appearance. The costly things were all within, and its outward covering of rough badger skin gave no hint of the valuable things which it contained.

</p>

<p>God may send you, dear friends, some costly packages. Do not worry if they are done up in rough wrappings. You may be sure there are treasures of love, and kindness, and wisdom hidden within. If we take what He sends, and trust Him for the goodness in it, even in the dark, we shall learn the meaning of the secrets of Providence.<br/> <em>--A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p><em>Not until each loom is silent,</em><br/> <em>And the shuttles cease to fly,</em><br/> <em>Will God unroll the pattern</em><br/> <em>And explain the reason why</em><br/> <em>The dark threads are as needful</em><br/> <em>In the Weaver's skillful hand,</em><br/> <em>As the threads of gold and silver</em><br/> <em>For the pattern which He planned.</em>

</p>

<p>He that is mastered by Christ is the master of every circumstance. Does the circumstance press hard against you? Do not push it away. It is the Potter's hand. Your mastery will come, not by arresting its progress, but by enduring its discipline, for it is not only shaping you into a vessel of beauty and honor, but it is making your resources available.
