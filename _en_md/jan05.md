<p><em>Lord, there is none beside thee to help. (</em>2 Chronicles 14:11<em>, RV).</em>

</p>

<p>Remind God of His entire responsibility. "There is none beside thee to help." The odds against Asa were enormous. There was a million of men in arms against him, besides three hundred chariots. It seemed impossible to hold his own against that vast multitude. There were no allies who would come to his help; his only hope, therefore, was in God.

</p>

<p>It may be that your difficulties have been allowed to come to so alarming a pitch that you may be compelled to renounce all creature aid, to which in lesser trials you have had recourse, and cast yourself back on your Almighty Friend. <em>Put God between yourself and the foe</em>.

</p>

<p>To Asa's faith, Jehovah seemed to stand between the might of Zerah and himself, as one who had no strength. Nor was he mistaken. We are told that the Ethiopians were destroyed before the Lord and before His host, as though celestial combatants flung themselves against the foe in Israel's behalf, and put the large host to rout, so that Israel had only to follow up and gather the spoil. Our God is Jehovah of hosts, who can summon unexpected reinforcements at any moment to aid His people. Believe that He is there between you and your difficulty, and what baffles you will flee before Him, as clouds before the gale.<br/> <em>--F. B. Meyer</em>

</p>

<p><em>When nothing whereon to lean remains,<br/> When strongholds crumble to dust;<br/> When nothing is sure but that God still reigns,<br/> That is just the time to trust.<br/> 'Tis better to walk by faith than sight,<br/> In this path of yours and mine;<br/> And the pitch-black night, when there's no outer light<br/> Is the time for faith to shine.</em>

</p>

<p>Abraham believed God, and said to sight, "Stand back!" and to the laws of nature, "Hold your peace!" and to a misgiving heart, "Silence, thou lying tempter!" He <em>believed</em> God.<br/> <em>--Joseph Parker</em>
