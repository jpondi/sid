<p><em>He giveth quietness (Job 34:29).</em>

</p>

<p>Quietness amid the dash of the storm. We sail the lake with Him still; and as we reach its middle waters, far from land, under midnight skies, suddenly a great storm sweeps down. Earth and hell seem arrayed against us, and each billow threatens to overwhelm. Then He arises from His sleep, and rebukes the winds and the waves; His hand waves benediction and repose over the rage of the tempestuous elements. His voice is heard above the scream of the wind in the cordage and the conflict of the billows, "Peace, be still!" Can you not hear it? And there is instantly a great calm. "He giveth quietness." Quietness amid the loss of inward consolations. He sometimes withdraws these, because we make too much of them. We are tempted to look at our joy, our ecstasies, our transports, or our visions, with too great complacency. Then love for love's sake, withdraws them. But, by His grace, He leads us to distinguish between them and Himself. He draws nigh, and whispers the assurance of His presence. Thus an infinite calm comes to keep our heart and mind. "He giveth quietness."

</p>

<p><em>"He giveth quietness." O Elder Brother,<br/> Whose homeless feet have pressed our path of pain,<br/> Whose hands have borne the burden of our sorrow,<br/> That in our losses we might find our gain.<br/> Of all Thy gifts and infinite consolings,<br/> I ask but this: in every troubled hour<br/> To hear Thy voice through all the tumults stealing,<br/> And rest serene beneath its tranquil power.<br/> Cares cannot fret me if my soul be dwelling<br/> In the still air of faith's untroubled day;<br/> Grief cannot shake me if I walk beside thee,<br/> My hand in Thine along the darkening way.<br/> Content to know there comes a radiant morning<br/> When from all shadows I shall find release,<br/> Serene to wait the rapture of its dawning--<br/> Who can make trouble when Thou sendest peace?</em>
