<p><em>I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing (</em>Ezekiel 34:26<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>What is your season today? Are you experiencing a season of drought? If so then it is the season for showers. Are you going through a season of great heaviness with dark clouds? Then that too is the season for showers. "Your strength will equal your days" (Deut. 33:25). "I will send... showers of blessing." Notice that the word 'showers' is plural.

</p>

<p>God will send all kinds of blessings. And all His blessings go together like links in a golden chain. If He gives you saving grace, He will also give you comforting grace. God will send "showers of blessings." Look up today, you who are dried and withered plants. Open your leaves and flowers and receive God's heavenly watering.<br/> <em>--Charles H. Spurgeon</em>

</p>

<p><em>Let but your heart become a valley low,<br/> And God will rain on it till it will overflow.</em>

</p>

<p>You, O Lord, can transform my thorn into a flower. And I do want my thorn transformed into a flower. Job received sunshine after the rain, but was the rain all wasted? Job wants to know, and I want to know, if the rain is related to the sunshine. Only You can tell me - Your cross can tell me. You have crowned Your sorrow. Let this be my crown, O Lord. I will only triumph in You once I have learned the radiance of the rain.<br/> <em>--George Matheson</em>

</p>

<p>The fruitful life seeks rain as well as sunshine.

</p>

<p><em>The landscape, brown and dry beneath the sun,<br/> Needs but the cloud to life it into life;<br/> The dews may dampen the tree and flower,<br/> But it requires the cloud-distilled shower<br/> To bring rich greenness to the lifeless life.<br/> Ah, how like this, the landscape of a life:<br/> Dews of trial fall like incense, rich and sweet;<br/> But meaning little in the crystal tray --<br/> Like moths of night, dews lift at break of day<br/> And fleeting impressions leave, like lips that meet.<br/> But clouds of trials, bearing burdens rare,<br/> Leave in the soul, a moisture settled deep:<br/> Life stirs by the powerful law of God;<br/> And where before the thirsty camel trod,<br/> There richest beauties to life's landscape leap.<br/> Then read you in each cloud that comes to you<br/> The words of Paul, in letters large and clear:<br/> So will those clouds your soul with blessing feed,<br/> And with a constant trust as you do read,<br/> All things together work for good. Fret not, nor fear!</em>
