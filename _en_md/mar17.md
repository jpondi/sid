<p><em>Be thou there till I bring thee word</em> (Matt. 2:13).

</p>

<p><em>I'll stay where You've put me;<br/> I will, dear Lord, Though I wanted so badly to go;<br/> I was eager to march with the 'rank and file,'<br/> Yes, I wanted to lead them, You know.<br/> I planned to keep step to the music loud,<br/> To cheer when the banner unfurled,<br/> To stand in the midst of the fight straight and proud,<br/> But I'll stay where You've put me.<br/> I'll stay where You've put me; I'll work, dear Lord,<br/> Though the field be narrow and small,<br/> And the ground be fallow, and the stones lie thick,<br/> And there seems to be no life at all.<br/> The field is Thine own, only give me the seed,<br/> I'll sow it with never a fear;<br/> I'll till the dry soil while I wait for the rain,<br/> And rejoice when the green blades appear;<br/> I'll work where You've put me.<br/> I'll stay where You've put me; I will, dear Lord;<br/> I'll bear the day's burden and heat,<br/> Always trusting Thee fully; when even has come<br/> I'll lay heavy sheaves at Thy feet.<br/> And then, when my earth work is ended and done,<br/> In the light of eternity's glow,<br/> Life's record all closed, I surely shall find<br/> It was better to stay than to go;<br/> I'll stay where You've put me.</em>

<p>Oh restless heart, that beat against your prison bars of circumstances, yearning for a wider sphere of usefulness, leave God to order all your days. Patience and trust, in the dullness of the routine of life, will be the best preparation for a courageous bearing of the tug and strain of the larger opportunity which God may some time send you.
