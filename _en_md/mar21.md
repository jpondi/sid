<p><em>According to your faith be it unto you</em> (Matt. 9:29).

</p>

<p>"Praying through" might be defined as praying one's way into full faith, emerging while yet praying into the assurance that one has been accepted and heard, so that one becomes actually aware of receiving, by firmest anticipation and in advance of the event, the thing for which he asks.

</p>

<p>Let us remember that no earthly circumstances can hinder the fulfillment of His Word if we look steadfastly at the immutability of that Word and not at the uncertainty of this ever-changing world. God would have us believe His Word without other confirmation, and then He is ready to give us "according to our faith."

</p>

<p>When once His Word is past,<br/> When He hath said , 'I will,' (Heb. 13:5)<br/> The thing shall come at last;<br/> God keeps His promise still. (2 Cor. 1:20)

</p>

<p>The prayer of the Pentecostal age was like a cheque to be paid in coin over the counter.<br/> <em>--Sir R. Anderson</em>

</p>

<p>"And God saidâ€¦ and it was so." (Gen. 1:9.)
