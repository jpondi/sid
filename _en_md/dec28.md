<p><em>"Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice"</em> (Phil. 4:4).

</p>

<p><em>"Sing a little song of trust,<br/> O my heart!<br/> Sing it just because you must,<br/> As leaves start;<br/> As flowers push their way through dust;<br/> Sing, my heart, because you must.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Wait not for an eager throng<br/> Bird on bird;<br/> 'Tis the solitary song<br/> That is heard.<br/> Every voice at dawn will start,<br/> Be a nightingale, my heart!</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Sing across the winter snow,<br/> Pierce the cloud;<br/> Sing when mists are drooping low<br/> Clear and loud;<br/> But sing sweetest in the dark;<br/> He who slumbers not will hark."</em>

</p>

<p>"An' when He hears yo' sing, He bends down wid a smile on His kin' face an' listens mighty keerful, an' He says, 'Sing on, chile, I hears, an' I's comin' down to deliber yo': I'll tote dat load fer yo'; jest lean hawd on Me and de road will get smoother bime by."'
