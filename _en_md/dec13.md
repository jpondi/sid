<p><br/> <em>I will give you the treasures of darkness</em> (Isaiah 45:3).

</p>

<p>In the famous lace shops of Brussels, there are certain rooms devoted to the spinning of the finest and most delicate patterns. These rooms are altogether darkened, save for a light from one very small window, which falls directly upon the pattern. There is only one spinner in the room, and he sits where the narrow stream of light falls upon the threads of his weaving. "Thus," we are told by the guide, "do we secure our choicest products. Lace is always more delicately and beautifully woven when the worker himself is in the dark and only his pattern is in the light."

</p>

<p>May it not be the same with us in our weaving? Sometimes it is very dark. We cannot understand what we are doing. We do not see the web we are weaving. We are not able to discover any beauty, any possible good in our experience. Yet if we are faithful and fail not and faint not, we shall some day know that the most exquisite work of all our life was done in those days when it was so dark.

</p>

<p>If you are in the deep shadows because of some strange, mysterious providence, do not be afraid. Simply go on in faith and love, never doubting. God is watching, and He will bring good and beauty out of all your pain and tears.<br/> --J. R. Miller

<p><em>The shuttles of His purpose move<br/> To carry out His own design;<br/> Seek not too soon to disapprove<br/> His work, nor yet assign<br/> Dark motives, when, with silent tread,<br/> You view some sombre fold;<br/> For lo, within each darker thread<br/> There twines a thread of gold.<br/> Spin cheerfully,<br/> Not tearfully,<br/> He knows the way you plod;<br/> Spin carefully,<br/> Spin prayerfully,<br/> But leave the thread with God.</em><br/> --Canadian Home Journal
