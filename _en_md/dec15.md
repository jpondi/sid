<p><em>Trust in the Lord and do what is right! Settle in the land and maintain your integrity</em>! —Ps 37:3

</p>

<p>The word trust is the heart word of faith. It is the Old Testament word, the word given to the early and infant stage of faith. The word faith expresses more the act of the will, the word belief the act of the mind or intellect, but trust is the language of the heart. The other has reference more to a truth believed or a thing expected.

</p>

<p>Trust implies more than this, it sees and feels, and leans upon a person, a great, true, living heart of love. So let us “trust also in him,” through all the delays, in spite of all the difficulties, in the face of all the denials, notwithstanding all the seemings, even when we cannot understand the way, and know not the issue; still “trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.” The way will open, the right issue will come, the end will be peace, the cloud will be lifted, and the light of an eternal noonday shall shine at last.

</p>

<p>“<em>Trust and rest when all around thee<br/> Puts thy faith to sorest test;<br/> Let no fear or foe confound thee,<br/> Wait for God and trust and rest.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Trust and rest with heart abiding,<br/> Like a birdling in its nest,<br/> Underneath His feathers hiding,<br/> Fold thy wings and trust and rest</em>.”

</p>
