<p><em>But prayer</em> (Acts 12:5).

</p>

<p>But prayer is the link that connects us with God. This is the bridge that spans every gulf and bears us over every abyss of danger or of need.

</p>

<p>How significant the picture of the Apostolic Church: Peter in prison, the Jews triumphant, Herod supreme, the arena of martyrdom awaiting the dawning of the morning to drink up the apostle's blood, and everything else against it. "But prayer was made unto God without ceasing." And what was the sequel? The prison open, the apostle free, the Jews baffled, the wicked king eaten of worms, a spectacle of hidden retribution, and the Word of God rolling on in greater victory.

</p>

<p>Do we know the power of our supernatural weapon? Do we dare to use it with the authority of a faith that commands as well as asks? God baptize us with holy audacity and Divine confidence! He is not wanting great men, but He is wanting men who will dare to prove the greatness of their God. But God! But prayer!Â <br/> <em>--A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p>Beware in your prayer, above everything, of limiting God, not only by unbelief, but by fancying that you know what He can do. Expect unexpected things, above all that we ask or think.

</p>

<p>Each time you intercede, be quiet first and worship God in His glory. Think of what He can do, of how He delights to hear Christ, of your place in Christ; and expect great things.<br/> <em>--Andrew Murray</em>

</p>

<p><em>Our prayers are God's opportunities</em>.

</p>

<p>Are you in sorrow? Prayer can make your affliction sweet and strengthening. Are you in gladness? Prayer can add to your joy a celestial perfume. Are you in extreme danger from outward or inward enemies? Prayer can set at your right hand an angel whose touch could shatter a millstone into smaller dust than the flour it grinds, and whose glance could lay an army low.

</p>

<p>What will prayer do for you? I answer: All that God can do for you. "Ask what I shall give thee."<br/> <em>--Farrar</em>

</p>

<p><em>Wrestling prayer can wonders do,<br/> Bring relief in deepest straits;<br/> Prayer can force a passage through<br/> Iron bars and brazen gates.</em>
