<p><em>God that cannot lie promised (Titus 1:2).</em>

</p>

<p>Faith is not working up by will power a sort of certainty that something is coming to pass, but it is seeing as an actual fact that God has said that this thing shall come to pass, and that it is true, and then rejoicing to know that it is true, and just resting because God has said it.

</p>

<p>Faith turns the promise into a prophecy. While it is merely a promise it is contingent upon our cooperation. But when faith claims it, it becomes a prophecy, and we go forth feeling that it is something that must be done because God cannot lie.<br/> <em>--Days of Heaven upon Earth</em>

</p>

<p>I hear men praying everywhere for more faith, but when I listen to them carefully, and get at the real heart of their prayer, very often it is not more faith at all that they are wanting, but a change from faith to sight.

</p>

<p>Faith says not, "I see that it is good for me, so God must have sent it," but, "God sent it, and so it must be good for me."

</p>

<p>Faith, walking in the dark with God, only prays Him to clasp its hand more closely.<br/> <em>--Phillips Brooks</em>

</p>

<p><em>The Shepherd does not ask of thee</em><br/> <em>Faith in thy faith, but only faith in Him;</em><br/> <em>And this He meant in saying, 'Come to me.'</em><br/> <em>In light or darkness seek to do His will,</em><br/> <em>And leave the. work of faith to Jesus still.</em>
