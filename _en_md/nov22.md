<p><em>Believe ye that I am able to do this?</em> (Matt. 9:28).

</p>

<p>God deals with impossibilities. It is never too late for Him to do so, when the impossible is brought to Him, in full faith, by the one in whose life and circumstances the impossible must be accomplished if God is to be glorified. If in our own life there have been rebellion, unbelief, sin, and disaster, it is never too late for God to deal triumphantly with these tragic facts if brought to Him in full surrender and trust.

</p>

<p>It has often been said, and with truth, that Christianity is the only religion that can deal with man's past. God can "restore the years that the locust hath eaten" (Joel 2:25); and He will do this when we put the whole situation and ourselves unreservedly andÂ  believingly into His hands. Not because of what we are but because of what He is. God forgives and heals and restores. He is "the God of all grace." Let us praise Him and trust Him.<br/> --<em>Sunday School Times</em>

<p>"Nothing is too hard for Jesus<br/> No man can work like Him."

</p>

<p>We have a God who delights in impossibilities and who asks, "Is anything too hard for me?"<br/> --<em>Andrew Murray</em>
