<p><em>"I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord"</em> (Phil. 3:8).

</p>

<p>This is the happy season of ripening cornfields, of the merry song of the reapers, of the secured and garnered grain. But let me hearken to the sermon of the field. This is its solemn word to me. You must die in order to live. You must refuse to consult your own case and well-being. You must be crucified, not only in desires and habits which are sinful, but in many more which appear innocent and right.Â If you would save others, you cannot save yourself. If you would bear much fruit, you must be buried in darkness and solitude.

</p>

<p>My heart fails me as I listen. But, when Jesus asks it, let me tell myself that it is my high dignity to enter into the fellowship of His sufferings; and thus I am in the best of company. And let me tell myself again that it is all meant to make me a vessel meet for His use. His own Calvary has blossomed into fertility; and so shall mine.

</p>

<p>Plenty out of pain, life out of death: is it not the law of the Kingdom?<br/> <em>--In the Hour of Silence</em>

</p>

<p>Do we call it dying when the bud bursts into flower?<br/> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Finding, following, keeping, struggling,<br/> Is He sure to bless?<br/> Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,<br/> Answer, 'Yes."'</em>
