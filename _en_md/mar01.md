<p><em>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked (Eccles. 7:13).</em>

</p>

<p>Often God seems to place His children in positions of profound difficulty, leading them into a wedge from which there is no escape; contriving a situation which no human judgment would have permitted, had it been previously consulted. The very cloud conducts them thither. You may be thus involved at this very hour.

</p>

<p>It does seem perplexing and very serious to the last degree, but it is perfectly right. The issue will more than justify Him who has brought you hither. It is a platform for the display of His almighty grace and power.

</p>

<p>He will not only deliver you; but in doing so, He will give you a lesson that you will never forget, and to which, in many a psalm and song, in after days, you will revert. You will never be able to thank God enough for having done just as He has.<br/> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>We may wait till He explains,</em><br/> <em><em>Because we know that Jesus reigns.</em><br/> <em>It puzzles me; but, Lord, Thou understandest,</em><br/> <em>And wilt one day explain this crooked thing.</em><br/> <em>Meanwhile, I know that it has worked out Thy best--</em><br/> <em>Its very crookedness taught me to cling.</em><br/> <em>Thou hast fenced up my ways, made my paths crooked,</em><br/> <em>To keep my wand'ring eyes fixed on Thee;</em><br/> <em>To make me what I was not, humble, patient;</em><br/> <em>To draw my heart from earthly love to Thee.</em><br/> <em>So I will thank and praise Thee for this puzzle,</em><br/> <em>And trust where I cannot understand.</em><br/> <em>Rejoicing Thou dost hold me worth such testing,</em></em><br/> <em>I cling the closer to Thy guiding hand.</em><br/> --F.E.M.I.
