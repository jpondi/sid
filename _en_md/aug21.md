<p><em>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me; because he delighted in me</em> (Psalms 18:19).

</p>

<p>And what is this "large place"? What can it be but God Himself, that infinite Being in whom all other beings and all other streams of life terminate? God is a large place indeed. And it was through humiliation, through abasement, through nothingness that David was brought into it.<br/> <em>--Madame Guyon</em>

<p>"I bare you on eagle's wings, and brought you unto myself" (Exod. 19:4).

</p>

<p><em>Fearing to launch on "full surrender's" tide,<br/> I asked the Lord where would its waters glide<br/> My little bark, "To troubled seas I dread?"<br/> "Unto Myself," He said.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Weeping beside an open grave I stood,<br/> In bitterness of soul I cried to God:<br/> "Where leads this path of sorrow that I tread?"<br/> "Unto Myself," He said.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Striving for souls, I loved the work too well;<br/> Then disappointments came; I could not tell<br/> The reason, till He said, "I am thine all;<br/> Unto Myself I call."</em>

</p>

<p><em>Watching my heroes--those I loved the best--<br/> I saw them fail; they could not stand the test,<br/> Even by this the Lord, through tears not few,<br/> Unto Himself me drew.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Unto Himself! No earthly tongue can tell<br/> The bliss I find, since in His heart I dwell;<br/> The things that charmed me once seem all as naught;<br/> Unto Himself I'm brought.</em><br/> --selected
