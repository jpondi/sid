<p><em>Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong</em>. (1 Cor 16:13)

</p>

<p>Do not pray for easy lives! Pray to be stronger men. Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks. Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle, but you shall be a miracle.<br/> <em>—Phillips Brooks</em>

</p>

<p>We must remember that it is not in any easy or self-indulgent life that Christ will lead us to greatness. The easy life leads not upward, but downward. Heaven always is above us, and we must ever be looking up toward it. These are some people who always avoid things that are costly, that require self-denial, or self-restraint and sacrifice, but toil and hardship show us the only way to nobleness. Greatness comes not by having a mossy path made for you through the meadow, but by being sent to hew out a roadway by your own hands. Are you going to reach the mountain splendors?<br/> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>Be strong!</em><br/> <em><em>We are not here to play, to dream, to drift;</em><br/> <em>We have hard work to do, and loads to lift.</em><br/> <em>Shun not the struggle; face it. ’Tis God’s gift.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Be strong!</em><br/> <em><em>Say not the days are evil—Who’s to blame?</em><br/> <em>And fold the hands and acquiesece—O shame!</em><br/> <em>Stand up, speak out, and bravely, In God’s name.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Be strong!</em><br/> <em><em>It matters not how deep entrenched the wrong,</em><br/> <em>How hard the battle goes, the day how long,</em><br/> <em>Faint not, fight on! Tomorrow comes the song.</em></em><br/> —Maltbie D. Babcock
