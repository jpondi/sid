<p><em>For even when we came into Macedonia, our body had no rest at all, but we were troubled in every way – struggles from the outside, fears from within</em> (2 Cor 7:5).

</p>

<p>Why should God have to lead us thus, and allow the pressure to be so hard and constant? Well, in the first place, it shows His all-sufficient strength and grace much better than if we were exempt from pressure and trial. “The treasure is in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”

</p>

<p>It makes us more conscious of our dependence upon Him. God is constantly trying to teach us our dependence, and to hold us absolutely in His hand and hanging upon His care.

</p>

<p>This was the place where Jesus Himself stood and where He wants us to stand, not with self-constituted strength, but with a hand ever leaning upon His, and a trust that dare not take one step alone. It teaches us trust.

</p>

<p>There is no way of learning faith except by trial. It is God’s school of faith, and it is far better for us to learn to trust God than to enjoy life.

</p>

<p>The lesson of faith once learned, is an everlasting acquisition and an eternal fortune made; and without trust even riches will leave us poor.<br/> <em>—Days of Heaven upon Earth</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Why must I weep when others sing?</em><br/> <em>’To test the deeps of suffering.’ </em><br/> <em>Why must I work while others rest?</em><br/> <em>’To spend my strength at God’s request.’ </em><br/> <em>Why must I lose while others gain?</em><br/> <em>’To understand defeat’s sharp pain.’ </em><br/> <em>Why must this lot of life be mine </em><br/> <em>When that which fairer seems is thine?</em><br/> <em>’Because God knows what plans for me </em><br/> <em>Shall blossom in eternity.’”</em>
