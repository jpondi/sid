<p><em>Trust in the Lord and do what is right! Settle in the land and maintain your integrity!</em> (Ps 37:3)

</p>

<p>I once met a poor woman, who earned a precarious living by hard daily labor; but who was a joyous triumphant Christian. “Ah, Nancy,” said a gloomy Christian lady to her one day, "it is well enough to be happy now; but I should think the thoughts of your future would sober you.

</p>

<p>“Only suppose, for instance, you should have a spell of sickness, and be unable to work; or suppose your present employers should move away, and no one else should give you anything to do; or suppose—”

</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Nancy, “I never supposes. De Lord is my Shepherd, and I knows I shall not want. And, Honey,” she added, to her gloomy friend, “it’s all dem supposes as is makin’ you so mis’able. You’d better give dem all up, and just trust de Lord.”

</p>

<p>There is one text that will take all the “supposes” out of a believer’s life, if it be received and acted on in childlike faith; it is Hebrews 13:5, 6: “Be content with such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.”<br/><em>—H. W. S.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“There’s a stream of trouble across my path;<br/> It is black and deep and wide.<br/> Bitter the hour the future hath<br/> When I cross its swelling tide.<br/> But I smile and sing and say:<br/> ’I will hope and trust alway;<br/> I’ll bear the sorrow that comes tomorrow,<br/> But I’ll borrow none today.’</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Tomorrow’s bridge is a dangerous thing;<br/> I dare not cross it now.<br/> I can see its timbers sway and swing,<br/> And its arches reel and bow.<br/> O heart, you must hope alway;<br/> You must sing and trust and say:<br/> ’I’ll bear the sorrow that comes tomorrow,<br/> But I’ll borrow none today.”’</em>

</p>

<p>The eagle that soars in the upper air does not worry itself as to how it is to cross rivers.<br/><em>—Selected</em>
