<p><em>Alone</em> (Deuteronomy 32:12).

</p>

<p><em>The hill was steep, but cheered along the way<br/> By converse sweet, I mounted on the thought<br/> That so it might be till the height was reached;<br/> But suddenly a narrow winding path<br/> Appeared, and then the Master said, 'My child,<br/> Here thou wilt safest walk with Me alone.'<br/> I trembled, yet my heart's deep trust replied,<br/> 'So be it, Lord.' He took my feeble hand<br/> In His, accepting thus my will to yield Him<br/> All, and to find all in Him.<br/> One long, dark moment,<br/> And no friend I saw, save Jesus only.<br/> But oh! so tenderly He led me on<br/> And up, and spoke to me such words of cheer,<br/> Such secret whisperings of His wondrous love,<br/> That soon I told Him all my grief and fear,<br/> And leaned on His strong arm confidingly.<br/> And then I found my footsteps quickened,<br/> And light ineffable, the rugged way<br/> Illumined, such light as only can be seen<br/> In close companionship with God.<br/> A little while, and we shall meet again<br/> The loved and lost; but in the rapturous joy<br/> Of greetings, such as here we cannot know,<br/> And happy song, and heavenly embraces,<br/> And tender recollections rushing back<br/> Of pilgrim life, methinks one memory<br/> More dear and sacred than the rest, shall rise,<br/> And we who gather in the golden streets,<br/> Shall oft be stirred to speak with grateful love<br/> Of that dark day when Jesus bade us climb<br/> Some narrow steep, leaning on Him alone.</em>
