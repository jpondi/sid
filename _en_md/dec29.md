<p><em>"Arise... for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good; and are ye still? Be not slothful to go, and enter to possess the land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth"</em> (Judges 18:9-10).

</p>

<p>Arise! Then there is something definite for us to do. Nothing is ours unless we take it. "The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance" (Joshua 16:4).

</p>

<p><em>"The house of Jacob shall possess their possessions"</em> (Obadiah 17).

</p>

<p><em>"The upright shall have good things in possession."</em>

</p>

<p>We need to have appropriating faith in regard to God's promises. We must make God's Word our own personal possession. A child was asked once what appropriating faith was, and the answer was, "It is taking a pencil and underscoring all the me's and mine's and my's in the Bible."

</p>

<p>Take any word you please that He has spoken and say, "That word is my word." Put your finger on this promise and say, "It is mine." How much of the Word has been endorsed and receipted and said "It is done." How many promises can you subscribe and say, "Fulfilled to me."

</p>

<p>"Son, thou art ever with Me, and all that I have is thine." Don't let your inheritance go by default.

</p>

<p>"When faith goes to market it always takes a basket."

</p>
