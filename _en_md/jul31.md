<p><em>David cared for them with pure motives; he led them with skill</em>.  Ps 78:72

</p>

<p>When you are doubtful as to your course, submit your judgment absolutely to the Spirit of God, and ask Him to shut against you every door but the right one…Meanwhile keep on as you are, and consider the absence of indication to be the indication of God’s will that you are on His track…As you go down the long corridor, you will find that He has preceded you, and locked many doors which you would fain have entered; but be sure that beyond these there is one which He has left unlocked. Open it and enter, and you will find yourself face to face with a bend of the river of opportunity, broader and deeper than anything you had dared to imagine in your sunniest dreams. Launch forth upon it; it conducts to the open sea.

</p>

<p>God guides us, often by circumstances. At one moment the way may seem utterly blocked; and then shortly afterward some trivial incident occurs, which might not seem much to others, but which to the keen eye of faith speaks volumes. Sometimes these things are repeated in various ways, in answer to prayer. They are not haphazard results of chance, but the opening up of circumstances in the direction in which we would walk. And they begin to multiply as we advance toward our goal, just as the lights do as we near a populous town, when darting through the land by night express.<br/> <em>—F. B. Meyer</em>

</p>

<p>If you go to Him to be guided, He will guide you; but He will not comfort your distrust or half-trust of Him by showing you the chart of all His purposes concerning you. He will show you only into a way where, if you go cheerfully and trustfully forward, He will show you on still farther.<br/> <em>—Horace Bushnell</em>

</p>

<p><em>As moves my fragile bark across the storm-swept sea,</em><br/> <em>Great waves beat o’er her side, as north wind blows;</em><br/> <em>Deep in the darkness hid lie threat’ning rocks and shoals;</em><br/> <em>But all of these, and more, my Pilot knows.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Sometimes when dark the night, and every light gone out,</em><br/> <em>I wonder to what port my frail ship goes;</em><br/> <em>Still though the night be long, and restless all my hours,</em><br/> <em>My distant goal, I’m sure, my Pilot knows.</em>

</p>
