<p><br/> <em>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep</em> (Ps. 107:23-24).

</p>

<p>He is but an apprentice and no master in the art, who has not learned that every wind that blows is fair for Heaven. The only thing that helps nobody, is a dead calm. North or south, cast or west, it matters not, every wind may help towards that blessed port. Seek one thing only: keep well out to sea, and then have no fear of stormy winds. Let our prayer be that of an old Cornishman: "O Lord, send us out to sea--out in the deep water. Here we are so close to the rocks that the first bit of breeze with the devil, we are all knocked to pieces. Lord, send us out to sea--out in the deep water, where we shall have room enough to get a glorious victory."<br/> <em>--Mark Guy Pearse</em>

</p>

<p>Remember that we have no more faith at any time than we have in the hour of trial. All that will not bear to be tested is mere carnal confidence. Fair-weather faith is no faith.<br/> <em>--C. H. Spurgeon</em>
