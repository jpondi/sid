<p><em>When thou passest through the waters... they shall not overflow thee (</em>Isaiah 43:2<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>God does not open paths for us in advance of our coming. He does not promise help before help is needed. He does not remove obstacles out of our way before we reach them. Yet when we are on the edge of our need, God's hand is stretched out.

</p>

<p>Many people forget this, and are forever worrying about difficulties which they foresee in the future. They expect that God is going to make the way plain and open before them, miles and miles ahead; whereas He has promised to do it only step by step as they may need. You must get to the waters and into their floods before you can claim the promise. Many people dread death, and lament that they have not "dying grace." Of course, they will not have dying grace when they are in good health, in the midst of life's duties, with death far in advance. Why should they have it then? Grace for duty is what they need then, living grace; then dying grace when they come to die.<br/> <em>--J. R. M.</em>

<p><em>"When thou passest through the waters"<br/> Deep the waves may be and cold,<br/> But Jehovah is our refuge,<br/> And His promise is our hold;<br/> For the Lord Himself hath said it,<br/> He, the faithful God and true:<br/> "When thou comest to the waters<br/> Thou shalt not go down, BUT THROUGH."<br/> Seas of sorrow, seas of trial,<br/> Bitterest anguish, fiercest pain,<br/> Rolling surges of temptation<br/> Sweeping over heart and brain<br/> They shall never overflow us<br/> For we know His word is true;<br/> All His waves and all His billows<br/> He will lead us safely through.<br/> Threatening breakers of destruction,<br/> Doubt's insidious undertow,<br/> Shall not sink us, shall not drag us<br/> Out to ocean depths of woe;<br/> For His promise shall sustain us,<br/> Praise the Lord, whose Word is true!<br/> We shall not go down, or under,<br/> For He saith, "Thou passest THROUGH."</em><br/> --Annie Johnson Flint
