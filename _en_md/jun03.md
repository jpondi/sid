<p><em>On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.” — </em>Mark 4:35

</p>

<p>Even when we go forth at Christ’s command, we need not expect to escape storms; for these disciples were going forth at Christ’s command, yet they encountered the fiercest storm and were in great danger of being overwhelmed, so that they cried out in their distress for Christ’s assistance.

</p>

<p>Though Christ may delay His coming in our time of distress, it is only that our faith may be tried and strengthened, and that our prayers may be more intense, and that our desires for deliverance may be increased, so that when the deliverance does come we will appreciate it more fully.

</p>

<p>Christ gave them a gentle rebuke, saying, “Where is your faith?” Why did you not shout victory in the very face of the storm, and say to the raging winds and rolling waves, “You can do no harm, for Christ, the mighty Savior is on board”?

</p>

<p>It is much easier to trust when the sun is shining than when the storm is raging.

</p>

<p>We never know how much real faith we have until it is put to the test in some fierce storm; and that is the reason why the Savior is on board.

</p>

<p>If you are ever to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might, your strength will be born in some storm.<br/> <em>--Selected</em>

<p><em>“With Christ in the vessel,</em><br/> <em>I smile at the storm.”</em>

</p>

<p>Christ said, “Let us go to the other side”—not to the middle of the lake to be drowned.<br/> <em>--Dan Crawford</em>
