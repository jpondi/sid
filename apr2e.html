<h1>🌄 <i>Streams in the Desert - April 2</i> 🌄</h1>

<div class="verse">
    <p>✨ <i>"They looked... and behold, the <span class="highlight">glory of the Lord</span> appeared in the cloud"</i> <b>(Exodus 16:10)</b> ✨</p>
</div>

<p>🌥️ <b>Train yourself</b> to look for the <i>bright side</i> of every dark cloud—and when you find it, <span class="highlight">keep looking at it</span>, not at the gloomy gray center.</p>

<p>💪 <b>Never give in</b> to discouragement, no matter how hard life gets. A discouraged person is helpless—they can't fight life's battles or pray effectively for others. 🛡️</p>

<p>🐍 <span class="highlight">Run from discouragement</span> like you'd run from a poisonous snake! Turn away quickly, unless you want to lie defeated in the dust. 🏃‍♂️</p>

<p>📖 <b>Search for God's promises</b> and declare out loud: <i>"This promise is mine!"</i> If doubt still creeps in, tell God everything and ask Him to silence the enemy attacking your mind. 🙏</p>

<p>⚡ <b>The moment you reject</b> doubt and discouragement, the Holy Spirit will <span class="highlight">strengthen your faith</span> and fill you with God's power. At first you might not feel it, but as you keep refusing negative thoughts, you'll sense the darkness retreating! ✨</p>

<p>👀 <i>If only we could see</i> the <b>army of angels</b> supporting us when we turn from darkness to God—we'd never fear the enemy's attempts to discourage us! 😇</p>

<div class="quote">
    <p>🛡️ <i>All of God's mighty power stands with <span class="highlight">even the weakest believer</span> who trusts in Christ and turns to Him for help.</i> —Selected</p>
</div>

<p>🦅 <b>Story of the Eagle:</b> One autumn day, I saw a prairie eagle shot by a hunter. Even dying, his eyes still shone bright. He slowly turned his head for <span class="highlight">one last longing look at the sky</span>—his true home where he once flew with the winds and lightnings. Now he lay dying because he flew too low just once. <i>Our souls are like that eagle.</i> Earth isn't our home—we must <b>keep looking heavenward</b>! Keep faith, hope, courage, and Christ. If we won't be brave, we should leave life's battlefield now. There's no time to panic. <span class="highlight">Keep looking up, my soul!</span> 🌤️</p>

<div class="poem">
    <p>🌟 <b>Keep looking up</b>—</p>
    <p>The waves roaring at your feet,</p>
    <p>God will defeat</p>
    <p>When you look up. 🌊</p>
    
    <p>🌟 <b>Keep looking up</b>—</p>
    <p>Though darkness covers your soul;</p>
    <p>God's light will make you whole</p>
    <p>When you look up. 💡</p>
    
    <p>🌟 <b>Keep looking up</b>—</p>
    <p>When tired from the fight;</p>
    <p>Christ gives conquering might</p>
    <p>When you look up. ⚔️</p>
</div>
