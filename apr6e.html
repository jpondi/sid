        <div class="verse">"I will stand at my watch and station myself on the tower. I will watch to see what he will say to me." <br>— Habakkuk 2:1</div>

        <p>🙏 <span class="highlight">If we don't watch for God's help, we won't receive it.</span> Many blessings pass us by because we're not looking for them! We must be ready to open our hearts when God moves. <span class="emoji">👀</span></p>

        <p>✨ There's an old saying: <span class="highlight">"People who watch for God's work will always see it."</span> But if you don't watch, you'll miss it! <span class="emoji">⏳</span> It's like putting out water jars when it rains - if you don't prepare, you won't catch any water. <span class="emoji">💧</span></p>

        <p>💰 <span class="highlight">We need to be serious when we ask God for help.</span> Imagine someone going to a bank, putting down a check, then picking it up without getting money - that's silly! Real customers present their checks and wait for their cash. <span class="emoji">🏦</span></p>

        <p>🔥 <span class="highlight">Many people play at praying</span> - they don't really expect answers! But God wants us to do <span class="emoji">🛑 REAL BUSINESS 🛑</span> with Him when we pray. Don't just talk about prayers - expect results! <span class="emoji">🙌</span></p>

        <p>💫 <span class="highlight">"Your hope will not be cut off."</span> <span class="emoji">✂️❌</span></p>
