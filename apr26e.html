        <p>💡 <span class="highlight">Shining always costs something.</span> Light only comes when something burns. A candle that's not lit gives no light. 🔥 Burning must happen before shining. We can't truly help others without it costing us something. Burning means suffering - and we naturally avoid pain.</p>

        <p>We often think we're most useful when we're strong and active - when our hands are full of good works. 🤲</p>

        <p>But when we're set aside to just suffer... when we're sick... in constant pain... when all our activities stop... we feel useless. 😔 Like we're not doing anything important.</p>

        <p>Yet if we're patient and surrendered, <span class="highlight">we may bless the world more through our suffering than through all our busy service.</span> We're burning now - and shining because we're burning.</p>

            <p>👑 Many want the crown without the cross,<br>
            ✨ The shining without the burning,<br>
            ✝️ But crucifixion comes before coronation.</p>

            ☀️ In sunny lands it grows so slow,<br>
            ⏳ A hundred years to bloom and show;<br>
            💐 Then bursts with flowers - a glorious sight,<br>
            🌺 The pride of tropics, pure and bright.<br>
            🌱 But the plant must die to give this flower,<br>
            ✨ One glorious bloom - its final hour.</p>

            <p>🌿 And yet from each dropped blossom fair,<br>
            🌱 New plants spring up to grow right there;<br>
            🔄 A thousand lives from one death true,<br>
            🌍 The old makes way for life anew.</p>

            <p>🦅 <span class="highlight">The Pelican's Tale</span><br>
            🏜️ In lonely desert lands it flies,<br>
            💧 Bringing water through the skies;<br>
            🐟 Fishing seas to feed its young,<br>
            ❤️ Greatest love e'er to be sung.<br>
            🩸 In famine gives its very blood,<br>
            ✝️ Dies to feed them - love so good.</p>

            🌍 He died - yet lives in souls untold,<br>
            ✨ His life still changing young and old;<br>
            🌱 His seed now fills the earth below,<br>
            🌟 As stars above in heaven glow.<br>
            ❤️ He taught to lose our life with cheer,<br>
            ☮️ That love's true life might then appear.<br>
            ✝️ His death our life, His loss our gain,<br>
