<h1>Streams in the Desert - March 10 🌿</h1>

<p><strong>But my righteous one will live by faith, and if he shrinks back, I take no pleasure in him.</strong> (Heb 10:38) 🙏</p>

<p>Sometimes, we replace faith with appearances and feelings. While joy and deep experiences are part of being a Christian, they aren’t everything. Challenges, struggles, and tests are also part of the journey. they’re not accidents but necessary lessons. 🌟</p>

<p>In all these experiences, we must trust that Christ is in our hearts, even if we don’t feel it, as long as we are following Him. Many people struggle because they rely on feelings instead of faith. 💔</p>

<p>One saint shared that she felt God had left her. His mercy seemed gone. For six weeks, she felt alone. Then, God spoke to her: “Catherine, you’ve been looking for Me in the outside world, but I’ve been inside you all along. Meet Me in your heart, for I am there.” 💖</p>

<p>We must separate the fact of God’s presence from our emotions. Even when we feel alone, faith can say, “I don’t see You. I don’t feel You, but I know You are here with me.” Repeat this: “You are here. Even if I don’t see the fire, the bush is burning. I will take off my shoes, for this is holy ground.” 🌄</p>

    <p><em>Believe God’s word and power more than your feelings and experiences. Your Rock is Christ, and it’s not the Rock that changes, but your emotions.</em> —Samuel Rutherford 🪨</p>
</div>

<p>Focus on the greatness of Christ’s work and righteousness. Look to Jesus and believe! Look to Jesus and live! Don’t stay stuck in doubt or let your feelings control you. Life with God isn’t about overthinking emotions. It’s about moving forward with faith, even in tough times. ⛵</p>

<p>Like a bird, safety comes from flying high. If we stay low, we risk getting caught in traps. If we focus only on feelings, we’ll get stuck in doubt and fear. But if we trust in God, we can soar above it all. 🕊️</p>
