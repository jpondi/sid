        <h1>Joy in the Morning - Streams in the Desert - April 14 🌅✝️</h1>

        <div class="verse">
            <p>"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: so shall we ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16-17). 📖✨</p>
        </div>

        <p><b>Jesus rose from the dead very early in the morning while it was still dark.</b> 🌄 The morning star shone on His empty tomb, not the sun. The city was still asleep when He arose. His resurrection didn't wake anyone in Jerusalem. 🌙</p>

        <p><b>In the same way, Christ's Church will rise "very early in the morning while it is still dark,"</b> with only the morning star shining. ✨ Like Jesus, believers will awake while others are still asleep in spiritual darkness. Their rising won't disturb anyone. The world won't hear God calling them home. 🏠</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Just as Jesus gently laid His saints to rest in their graves, He will gently wake them when the time comes. 💐 They will hear the life-giving words: <i>"Awake and sing, you who live in the dust"</i> (Isa. 26:19). The first rays of glory will shine into their tombs. ☀️</p>
        </div>

        <p>They will experience the first signs of morning - its fresh smell, quiet peace, clean air, and hopeful solitude. All these wonderful things will belong to them. 🌿</p>

        <p><b>What a difference between these joys and the dark night they've come through!</b> What a change from the grave they're leaving behind! ⚡ As they throw off their earthly bodies and rise with new heavenly bodies to meet Jesus in the sky, the Morning Star will guide them - just like the Bethlehem Star once guided others to the newborn King. 🌟</p>

        <p><i>"Weeping may last for a night, but joy comes in the morning."</i> 😢➡️😊</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p class="point">"While crowds shout 'Hosanna,' Jesus will come down from heaven with His glorified saints and attending angels. With grace shining like a halo, He will welcome His own." 👑</p>
            <p class="point">"Yes, come quickly, Lord Jesus!" 🙏</p>
        </div>

        <p>A Christian soldier once said: <i>"When I die, don't play taps at my grave. Play reveille instead - the morning call, the music that says 'Wake up!'"</i> 🎺</p>

        <div class="footer">
