    <h1>📖 Streams in the Desert - March 4 ⛅</h1>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises (Heb. 6:12) 🙏✨</span></p>
    
    <p>They (heroes of faith) are calling to us from the heights that they have won 🏔️, and telling us that what man once did, man can do again 💪. Not only do they remind us of the necessity of <b>faith</b> ✨, but also of that <i>patience</i> by which faith has its perfect work ⏳.</p>
    
    <p class="quote">Let us fear to take ourselves out of the hands of our heavenly Guide or to miss a single lesson of His loving discipline by discouragement or doubt. 🤲</p>
    
    <p>"There is only one thing," said a village blacksmith, "that I fear, and that is to be thrown on the scrap heap. 🛠️🚮"</p>
    
    <p>"When I am tempering a piece of steel 🔩, I first beat it 🔨, hammer it, and then suddenly plunge it into this bucket of cold water 💦. I very soon find whether it will take temper or go to pieces in the process. When I discover after one or two tests that it is not going to allow itself to be tempered, I throw it on the scrap heap and sell it for a cent a pound when the junk man comes around. 💰"</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"So I find the Lord tests me, too, by fire 🔥 and water 🌊 and heavy blows of His heavy hammer, and if I am not willing to stand the test, or am not going to prove a fit subject for His tempering process, I am afraid He may throw me on the scrap heap." 😨</p>
    
    <p><b>When the fire is hottest, hold still</b> 🔥✋, for there will be a blessed "afterward" 😊; and with Job we may be able to say, <i>"When he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold."</i> 🏆✨</p>
    
    <h2>🌿 Sainthood springs out of suffering 🌿</h2>
    
    <p>It takes <b>eleven tons</b> of pressure on a piano 🎹 to tune it. <b>God will tune you</b> 🎶 to harmonize with Heaven's key-note if you can stand the strain. 🌟</p>
    
    <p class="quote">Things that hurt and things that mar 🎭<br>
    Shape the man for perfect praise 🎶<br>
    Shock and strain and ruin are 💥<br>
    Friendlier than the smiling days. 😊</p>
