    <h1>Streams in the Desert - March 15</h1>

    <p><span class="verse">"Don’t be afraid, despised insignificant Jacob, men of Israel. I am helping you," says the Lord, your protector, the Holy One of Israel. "Look, I am making you like a sharp threshing sledge, new and double-edged. You will thresh the mountains and crush them; you will make the hills like straw."</span> (Isaiah 41:14-15) 🌄🔥</p>

    <p>Could any two things be more different than a <span class="emphasize">worm</span> and a <span class="emphasize">sharp tool with teeth</span>? 🐛⚒️ The worm is fragile—it can be crushed by a stone or a wheel. But a tool with teeth is strong; it can break rocks and leave its mark. 💪✨</p>

    <p>Our mighty God can change the weak into the strong. He can take a person or a nation, as helpless as a worm, and fill them with His Spirit’s power. 🌟 This strength can leave a lasting impact on history. 📜</p>

    <p>So, if you feel like a <span class="emphasize">worm</span>, take heart! 💖 God can make you stronger than your struggles. He can turn everything around for your good. 🌈 With His strength, even disappointments can become opportunities for growth. 💎 When God gives us strong wills, we can overcome any challenge, just like an iron tool cuts through tough soil. ⚔️🌱</p>

    <p><span class="highlight">"I will make thee,"</span> and He will do it! 🙌</p>
    <p>—Dr. Jowett</p>

    <p>Christ is building His kingdom with broken things. 🏰💔 People often want only the strong, successful, and unbroken to build their kingdoms. But God loves the weak, the failed, and the broken. 🌟 Heaven is filled with lives that were once shattered, but Christ has restored them to beauty and joy. 🌈✨ He can take a life crushed by pain and turn it into a harp that sings praises. 🎶 He can lift even the saddest failure to heavenly glory. 🌠</p>
    <p>—J. R. Miller</p>

    <p class="poem">"Follow Me, and I will make you" ✝️<br>
    Make you speak My words with power, 🗣️💥<br>
    Make you channels of My mercy, 🌊❤️<br>
    Make you helpful every hour. ⏳🤝</p>

    <p class="poem">"Follow Me, and I will make you" ✝️<br>
    Make you what you cannot be 🌟<br>
    Make you loving, trustful, godly, 💖🙏<br>
    Make you even like to Me. 👑✨</p>
    <p>—L. S. P.</p>
