        <div class="verse">
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">"And the hand of the Lord was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth unto the plain, and I will there talk with thee"</span> (Ezek. 3:22).
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <span class="highlight">Have you ever heard of anyone being greatly used by Christ who didn't first go through a special waiting time?</span> 🌄 From St. Paul being sent to the Arabian desert for three years (when he must have been eager to share the good news) to people today - God often prepares His servants through waiting.
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            Maybe you were excited to tell others about trusting Jesus in Syria. But God says, <span class="highlight">"I want you to show what it means to trust Me right now - without waiting for Syria."</span> 🙏
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            My own story is less dramatic but similar. When I thought doors were opening for my writing career, a doctor stopped me saying, <span class="highlight">"Never! She must choose between writing and living - she can't do both."</span> ✍️ That was in 1860. My first book "Ministry of Song" finally came out in 1869. Now I see God's wisdom in making me wait those nine quiet years. 
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <span class="highlight">God's love never changes.</span> 💖 He loves us just as much when we don't feel His love. His love and His perfect control work together. Sometimes He holds back visible progress because He knows what will truly help us grow.

            <div class="poem-line">I laid it down in silence,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">This work of mine,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And took what had been sent me—</div>
            <div class="poem-line">A resting time. 🌿</div>
            <br>
            <div class="poem-line">The Master's voice had called me</div>
            <div class="poem-line">To rest apart;</div>
            <div class="poem-line">"Apart with Jesus only,"</div>
            <div class="poem-line">Echoed my heart. 💓</div>
            <br>
            <div class="poem-line">I took the rest and stillness</div>
            <div class="poem-line">From His own Hand,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">And felt this present illness</div>
            <div class="poem-line">Was what He planned. ✝️</div>
            <br>
            <div class="poem-line">How often we choose labor,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">When He says "Rest"—</div>
            <div class="poem-line">Our ways are blind and crooked;</div>
            <div class="poem-line">His way is best. 🛐</div>

            <div class="poem-line">The work Himself has given,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">He will complete.</div>
            <div class="poem-line">There may be other errands</div>
            <div class="poem-line">For tired feet; 👣</div>
            <br>
            <div class="poem-line">There is a blessed resting</div>
            <div class="poem-line">In lying still,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">In letting His hand mould us,</div>
            <div class="poem-line">Just as He will. 👐</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <span class="highlight">God gives us both places to rest and places to work.</span> ⛅ When He brings you, tired, to a quiet place by the road - rest there, and be thankful.
