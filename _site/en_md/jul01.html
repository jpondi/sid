        <p><em>And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled</em>. (Luke 1:45)

</p>

<p><em>My words shall be fulfilled in their season (their fixed appointed time)</em> (Greek, Luke 1:20).

</p>

<p><em>There shall be a performance of those things</em><br /> <em><em>That loving heart hath waited long to see;</em><br /> <em>Those words shall be fulfilled to which she clings,</em><br /> <em>Because her God hath promised faithfully;</em><br /> <em>And, knowing Him, she ne’er can doubt His Word;</em><br /> <em>“He speaks and it is done.” The mighty Lord!</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>There shall be a performance of those things,</em><br /> <em><em>O burdened heart, rest ever in His care;</em><br /> <em>In quietness beneath His shadowing wings</em><br /> <em>Await the answer to thy longing prayer.</em><br /> <em>When thou hast “cast thy care,” the heart then sings,</em><br /> <em>There shall be a performance of those things.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>There shall be a performance of those things,</em><br /> <em><em>O tired heart, believe and wait and pray;</em><br /> <em>At eventide the peaceful vesper rings,</em><br /> <em>Though cloud and rain and storm have filled the day.</em><br /> <em>Faith pierces through the mist of doubt that bars</em><br /> <em>The coming night sometimes, and finds the stars.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>There shall be a performance of those things,</em><br /> <em><em>O trusting heart, the Lord to thee hath told;</em><br /> <em>Let Faith and Hope arise, and plume their wings,</em><br /> <em>And soar towards the sunrise clouds of gold;</em><br /> <em>The portals of the rosy dawn swing wide,</em><br /> <em>Revealing joys the darkening night did hide.</em></em><br /> —Bessie Porter

</p>

<p>Matthew Henry says: "We must depend upon the performance of the promise, when all the ways leading up to it are shut up. ’For all the promises of God in him are yea (yes), and in him Amen (so be it), unto the glory of God by us.’ (2 Cor. 1:20).
