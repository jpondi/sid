        <p><em>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</em> (Rom. 3:3).

</p>

<p>I think that I can trace every scrap of sorrow in my life to simple unbelief. How could I be anything but quite happy if I believed always that all the past is forgiven, and all the present furnished with power, and all the future bright with hope because of the same abiding facts which do not change with my mood, do not stumble because I totter and stagger at the promise through unbelief, but stand firm and clear with their peaks of pearl cleaving the air of Eternity, and the bases of their hills rooted unfathomably in the Rock of God. Mont Blanc does not become a phantom or a mist because a climber grows dizzy on its side.<br /> <em>--James Smetham</em>

</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that, when we stagger at any promise of God through unbelief, we do not receive it? Not that faith merits an answer, or in any way earns it, or works it out; but God has made believing a condition of receiving, and the Giver has a sovereign right to choose His own terms of gift.<br /> <em>--Rev. Samuel Hart</em>

</p>

<p>Unbelief says, "How can such and such things be?" It is full of "hows"; but faith has one great answer to the ten thousand "hows," and that answer is--GOD! <br /> <em>--C. H. M.</em>

</p>

<p>No praying man or woman accomplishes so much with so little expenditure of time as when he or she is praying.

</p>

<p>If there should arise, it has been said--and the words are surely true to the thought of our Lord Jesus Christ in all His teaching on prayer—if there should arise ONE UTTERLY BELIEVING MAN, the history of the world might be changed.

</p>

<p>Will YOU not be that one in the providence and guidance of God our Father?<br /> <em>--A. E. McAdam</em>

</p>

<p>Prayer without faith degenerates into objectless routine, or soulless hypocrisy. Prayer with faith brings Omnipotence to back our petitions. Better not pray unless and until your whole being responds to the efficacy of your supplication. When the true prayer is breathed, earth and heaven, the past and the future, say Amen. And Christ prayed such prayers.<br /> <em>--P. C. M.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Nothing lies beyond the reach of prayer except that which lies outside the will of God.</em>
