        <p><em>You will hear a word spoken behind you, saying, “This is the correct way, walk in it,” whether you are heading to the right or the left</em>. (Isa 30:21)

</p>

<p>When we are in doubt or difficulty, when many voices urge this course or the other, when prudence utters one advice and faith another, then let us be still, hushing each intruder, calming ourselves in the sacred hush of God’s presence; let us study His Word in the attitude of devout attention; let us lift up our nature into the pure light of His face, eager only to know what God the Lord shall determine—and ere long a very distinct impression will be made, the unmistakable forth-telling of His secret counsel.

</p>

<p>It is not wise in the earlier stages of Christian life to depend on this alone, but to wait for the corroboration of circumstances. But those who have had many dealings with God know well the value of secret fellowship with Him, to ascertain His will.

</p>

<p>Are you in difficulty about your way? Go to God with your question; get direction from the light of His smile or the cloud of His refusal.

</p>

<p>If you will only get alone, where the lights and shadows of earth cannot interfere, where human opinions fail to reach and if you will dare to wait there silent and expectant, though all around you insist on immediate decision or action—the will of God will be made clear; and you will have a new conception of God, a deeper insight into His nature and heart of love, which shall be for yourself alone a rapturous experience, to abide your precious perquisite forever, the rich guerdon of those long waiting hours.<br /> <em>—David</em>

</p>

<p><em>“STAND STILL,” my soul, for so thy Lord commands: </em><br /> <em>E’en when thy way seems blocked, leave it in His wise hands; </em><br /> <em>His arm is mighty to divide the wave. </em><br /> <em>“Stand still,” my soul, “stand still” and thou shalt see </em><br /> <em>How God can work the “impossible” for thee, </em><br /> <em>For with a great deliverance He doth save.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Be not impatient, but in stillness stand, </em><br /> <em>Even when compassed ’round on every hand, </em><br /> <em>In ways thy spirit does not comprehend. </em><br /> <em>God cannot clear thy way till thou art still, </em><br /> <em>That He may work in thee His blessed will, </em><br /> <em>And all thy heart and will to Him do bend.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“BE STILL,” my soul, for just as thou art still, </em><br /> <em>Can God reveal Himself to thee; until </em><br /> <em>Through thee His love and light and life can freely flow; </em><br /> <em>In stillness God can work through thee and reach </em><br /> <em>The souls around thee. He then through thee can teach </em><br /> <em>His lessons, and His power in weakness show.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“BE STILL”—a deeper step in faith and rest. </em><br /> <em>“Be still and know” thy Father knoweth best </em><br /> <em>The way to lead His child to that fair land, </em><br /> <em>A “summer” land, where quiet waters flow; </em><br /> <em>Where longing souls are satisfied, and “know </em><br /> <em>Their God,” and praise for all that He has planned.</em><br /> —Selected
