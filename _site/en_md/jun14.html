        <p><em>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. When you have turned back, strengthen your brothers. </em>(Luke 22:32)

</p>

<p>Christian, take good care of thy faith, for recollect that faith is the only means whereby thou canst obtain blessings. Prayer cannot draw down answers from God’s throne except it be the earnest prayer of the man who believes.

</p>

<p>Faith is the telegraphic wire which links earth to Heaven, on which God’s messages of love fly so fast that before we call He answers, and while we are yet speaking He hears us. But if that telegraphic wire of faith be snapped, how can we obtain the promise?

</p>

<p>Am I in trouble? I can obtain help for trouble by faith. Am I beaten about by the enemy? My soul on her dear Refuge leans by faith.

</p>

<p>But take faith away, then in vain I call to God. There is no other road betwixt my soul and Heaven. Blockade the road, and how can I communicate with the Great King?

</p>

<p>Faith links me with Divinity. Faith clothes me with the power of Jehovah. Faith insures every attribute of God in my defense. It helps me to defy the hosts of hell. It makes me march triumphant over the necks of my enemies. But without faith how can I receive anything from the Lord?

</p>

<p>Oh, then, Christian, watch well thy faith. “If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”<br /> <em>—C. H. Spurgeon</em>

</p>

<p>We boast of being so practical a people that we want to have a surer thing than faith. But did not Paul say that the promise was, by FAITH that it might be SURE? (Romans 4:16)<br /> <em>—Dan Crawford</em>.

</p>

<p>Faith honors God; God honors faith.
