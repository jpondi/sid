        <p><em>He withdrew... to a solitary place (</em>Matthew 14:13<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>There is no music during a musical rest, but the rest is part of the making of the music. In the melody of our life, the music is separated here and there by rests. During those rests, we foolisly believe we have come to the end fo the song. God sends us time of forced leisure by allowing sickness, disappointed plans, and frustrated efforts. He brings a sudden pause in the choral hymns of our lives, and we lament that our voices must be silent. We grieve that our part is missing in the music that continually rises to the ear of our Creator. Yet how does a musician read the rest? He counts the break with unwavering precision and plays his next note with confidence, as if no pause were ever there.

</p>

<p>God does not write the music of our lives without a plan. Our part is to learn the tune and not be discouraged during the rests. They are not to be slurred over or omitted, nor used to destroy the melody or to change the key. If we will only look up, God Himself will count the time for us. With our eyes on Him, our next note will be full and clear. If we sorrowfully say to ourselves, "There is no music in a rest," let us not forget that the rest is part of the making of the music. The process is often slow and painful in this life, yet how patiently God works to teach us! And how long He waits for us to learn the lesson!<br /> <em>--John Ruskin</em>

<p><em>Called aside--<br /> From the glad working of your busy life,<br /> From the world's ceaseless stir of care and strife,<br /> Into the shade and stillness by your Heavenly Guide<br /> For a brief time you have been called aside.<br /> Called aside--<br /> Perhaps into a desert garden dim;<br /> And yet not alone, when you have been with Him,<br /> And heard His voice in sweetest accents say:<br /> "Child, will you not with Me this still hour stay?"<br /> Called aside--<br /> In hidden paths with Christ your Lord to tread,<br /> Deeper to drink at the sweet Fountainhead,<br /> Closer in fellowship with Him to roam,<br /> Nearer, perhaps, to feel your Heavenly Home.<br /> Called aside--<br /> Oh, knowledge deeper grows with Him alone;<br /> In secret oft His deeper love is shown,<br /> And learned in many an hour of dark distress<br /> Some rare, sweet lesson of His tenderness.<br /> Called aside--<br /> We thank You for the stillness and the shade;<br /> We thank You for the hidden paths Your love has made,<br /> And, so that we have wept and watched with Thee,<br /> We thank You for our dark Gethsemane.<br /> Called aside--<br /> O restful thought - He doeth all things well;<br /> O blessed sense, with Christ alone to dwell;<br /> So in the shadow of Your cross to hide,<br /> We thank You, Lord, to have been called aside.</em>
