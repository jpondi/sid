        <p><em>The Lord said to Moses, “Why do you cry out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on</em>. (Exod 14:15)

</p>

<p><em>In the past he said to them, “This is where security can be found. Provide security for the one who is exhausted! This is where rest can be found.” But they refused to listen</em>. (Isa 28:12)

</p>

<p>Why dost thou worry thyself? What use can thy fretting serve? Thou art on board a vessel which thou couldst not steer even if the great Captain put thee at the helm, of which thou couldst not so much as reef a sail, yet thou worriest as if thou wert captain and helmsman. Oh, be quiet; God is Master!

</p>

<p>Dost thou think that all this din and hurly-burly that is abroad betokens that God has left His throne?

</p>

<p>No, man, His coursers rush furiously on, and His chariot is the storm; but there is a bit between their jaws, and He holds the reins, and guides them as He wills! Jehovah is Master yet; believe it; peace be unto thee! be not afraid.<br /> <em>--C. H. Spurgeon</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Tonight, my soul, be still and sleep;</em><br /> <em>The storms are raging on God’s deep—</em><br /> <em>God’s deep, not thine; be still and sleep.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Tonight, my soul, be still and sleep;</em><br /> <em>God’s hands shall still the tempter’s sweep—</em><br /> <em>God’s hands, not thine; be still and sleep.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Tonight, my soul, be still and sleep;</em><br /> <em>God’s love is strong while night hours creep—</em><br /> <em>God’s love, not thine; be still and sleep.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Tonight, my soul, be still and sleep;</em><br /> <em>God’s heaven will comfort those who weep—</em><br /> <em>God’s heaven, not thine; be still and sleep."</em>

</p>

<p>I entreat you, give no place to despondency. This is a dangerous temptation—a refined, not a gross temptation of the adversary. Melancholy contracts and withers the heart, and renders it unfit to receive the impressions of grace. It magnifies and gives a false coloring to objects, and thus renders your burdens too heavy to bear. God’s designs regarding you, and His methods of bringing about these designs, are infinitely wise.<br /> <em>--Madame Guyon</em>
