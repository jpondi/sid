        <p><em>My grace <strong>is</strong> sufficient for thee</em> (2 Corinthians 12:9).

</p>

<p>It had pleased God to remove my youngest child under circumstances of peculiar trial and pain; and as I had just laid my little one's body in the churchyard, on return home, I felt it my duty to preach to my people on the meaning of trial.

</p>

<p>Finding that this text was in the lesson for the following Sabbath, I chose it as my Master's message to them and myself; but on trying to prepare the notes, I found that in honesty I could not say that the words were true; and therefore I knelt down and asked God to let His grace be sufficient for me. While I was thus pleading, I opened my eyes and saw a framed illuminated text, which my mother had given me only a few days before, and which I had told my servant to place upon the wall during my absence at the holiday resort where my little one was taken away from us. I did not notice the words on returning to my house; but as I looked up and wiped my eyes, the words met my gaze, "My grace is sufficient for thee."

</p>

<p>The "is" was picked out in bright green while the "My" and the "thee" were painted in another color. In one moment the message came straight to my soul, as a rebuke for offering such a prayer as, "Lord, let Thy grace be sufficient for me"; for the answer was almost as an audible voice, "How dare you ask that which is?"

</p>

<p>God cannot make it any more sufficient than He has made it; get up and believe it, and you will find it true, because the Lord says it in the simplest way: "My grace is (not shall be or may be) sufficient for thee." "My," "is," and "thee" were from that moment, I hope, indelibly fixed upon my heart; and I (thank God) have been trying to live in the reality of the message from that day forward to the present time.

</p>

<p>The lesson that came to me, and which I seek to convey to others, is, Never turn God's facts into hopes, or prayers, but simply use them as realities, and you will find them powerful as you believe them.<br /> <em>--Prebendary H. W. Webb Peploe</em>

</p>

<p><em>He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,</em><br /> <em>He sendeth more strength when the labors increase;</em><br /> <em>To added affliction He addeth His mercies,</em><br /> <em>To multiplied trials His multiplied peace.</em><br /> <em>When we have exhausted our store of endurance,</em><br /> <em>When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,</em><br /> <em>When we reach the end of our hoarded resources</em><br /> <em>Our Father's full giving is only begun.</em><br /> <em>His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,</em><br /> <em>His power no boundary known unto men;</em><br /> <em>For out of His infinite riches in Jesus</em><br /> <em>He giveth and giveth and giveth again.</em><br /> --Annie Johnson Flint
