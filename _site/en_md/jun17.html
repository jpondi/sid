        <p><em>Then there was a voice from above the platform over their heads when they stood still</em>. (Ezek 1:25)

</p>

<p>That is the letting down of the wings? People so often say, “How do you get the voice of the Lord?” Here is the secret. They heard the voice when they stood and let down their wings.

</p>

<p>We have seen a bird with fluttering wings; though standing still, its wings are fluttering. But here we are told they heard the voice when they stood and had let down their wings.

</p>

<p>Do we not sometimes kneel or sit before the Lord and yet feel conscious of a fluttering of our spirits? Not a real stillness in His presence.

</p>

<p>A dear one told me several days ago of a certain thing she prayed about, “But,” said she, “I did not wait until the answer came.”

</p>

<p>She did not get still enough to hear Him speak, but went away and followed her own thought in the matter. And the result proved disastrous and she had to retrace her steps.

</p>

<p>Oh, how much energy is wasted! How much time is lost by not letting down the wings of our spirit and getting very quiet before Him! Oh, the calm, the rest, the peace which come as we wait In His presence until we hear from Him!

</p>

<p>Then, ah then, we can go like lightning, and turn not as we go but go straight forward whithersoever the Spirit goes. (Ezek. 1:1, 20)

</p>

<p><em>“Be still! Just now be still!</em><br /> <em><em>Something thy soul hath never heard,</em><br /> <em>Something unknown to any song of bird,</em><br /> <em>Something unknown to any wind, or wave, or star,</em><br /> <em>A message from the Fatherland afar,</em><br /> <em>That with sweet joy the homesick soul shall thrill,</em><br /> <em>Cometh to thee if thou canst but be still.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>“Be still! Just now be still!</em><br /> <em><em>There comes a presence very mild and sweet;</em><br /> <em>White are the sandals of His noiseless feet.</em><br /> <em>It is the Comforter whom Jesus sent</em><br /> <em>To teach thee what the words He uttered meant.</em><br /> <em>The willing, waiting spirit, He doth fill.</em><br /> <em>If thou would’st hear His message,</em><br /> <em>Dear soul, be still!”</em></em>
