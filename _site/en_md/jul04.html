        <p><em>For the Vision is yet for an appointed time…though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry</em> (Hab. 2:3).

</p>

<p>In the charming little booklet, <em>Expectation Corner</em>, Adam Slowman was led into the Lord's treasure houses, and among many other wonders there revealed to him was the "Delayed Blessings Office," where God kept certain things, prayed for, until the wise time came to send them.

</p>

<p>It takes a long time for some pensioners to learn that delays are not denials. Ah, there are secrets of love and wisdom in the "Delayed Blessings Department," which are little dreamt of! Men would pluck their mercies green when the Lord would have them ripe.

</p>

<p>"Therefore will the Lord WAIT, that He may be gracious unto you" (Isa. 30:18). He is watching in the hard places and will not allow one trial too many; He will let the dross be consumed, and then He will come gloriously to your help.

</p>

<p>Do not grieve Him by doubting His love. Nay, lift up your head, and begin to praise Him even now for the deliverance which is on the way to you, and you will be abundantly rewarded for the delay which has tried your faith.

</p>

<p><em>O Thou of little faith,<br /> God hath not failed thee yet!<br /> When all looks dark and gloomy,<br /> Thou dost so soon forget--<br /> Forget that He has led thee,<br /> And gently cleared thy way;<br /> On clouds has poured His sunshine,<br /> And turned thy night to day.<br /> And if He's helped thee hitherto,<br /> He will not fail thee now;<br /> How it must wound His loving heart<br /> To see thy anxious brow!<br /> Oh! doubt not any longer,<br /> To Him commit thy way,<br /> Whom in the past thou trusted,<br /> And is "just the same today."</em><br /> <em>--</em>Selected
