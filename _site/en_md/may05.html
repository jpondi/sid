        <p><em>When they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushments... and they were smitten</em> (2 Chron. 20:22).

</p>

<p>Oh, that we could reason less about our troubles, and sing and praise more! There are thousands of things that we wear as shackles which we might use as instruments with music in them, if we only knew how. Those men that ponder, and meditate, and weigh the affairs of life, and study the mysterious developments of God's providence, and wonder why they should be burdened and thwarted and hampered--how different and how much more joyful would be their lives, if, instead of forever indulging in self-revolving and inward thinking, they would take their experiences, day by day, and lift them up, and praise God for them.

</p>

<p>We can sing our cares away easier than we can reason them away. Sing in the morning. The birds are the earliest to sing, and birds are more without care than anything else that I know of. Sing at evening. Singing is the last thing that robins do. When they have done their daily work; when they have flown their last flight, and picked up their last morsel of food, then on a topmost twig, they sing one song of praise.

</p>

<p>Oh, that we might sing morning and evening, and let song touch song all the way through.<br /> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>Don't let the song go out of your life</em><br /> <em>Though it chance sometimes to flow</em><br /> <em>In a minor strain; it will blend again</em><br /> <em>With the major tone you know.</em>

</p>

<p><em>What though shadows rise to obscure life's skies,</em><br /> <em>And hide for a time the sun,</em><br /> <em>The sooner they'll lift and reveal the rift,</em><br /> <em>If you let the melody run.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Don't let the song go out of your life;</em><br /> <em>Though the voice may have lost its trill,</em><br /> <em>Though the tremulous note may die in your throat,</em><br /> <em>Let it sing in your spirit still.</em>

</p>

<p><em>Don't let the song go out of your life;</em><br /> <em>Let it ring in the soul while here;</em><br /> <em>And when you go hence, 'twill follow you thence,</em><br /> <em>And live on in another sphere.</em>

</p>
