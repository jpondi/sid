        <p><br /> <em>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed"</em> (Heb. 11:8).

</p>

<p>Whither he went, he knew not; it was enough for him to know that he went with God. He leant not so much upon the promises as upon the Promiser. He looked not on the difficulties of his lot, but on the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, who had deigned to appoint his course, and would certainly vindicate Himself. O glorious faith! This is thy work, these are thy possibilities; contentment to sail with sealed orders, because of unwavering confidence in the wisdom of the Lord High Admiral; willinghood to rise up, leave all, and follow Christ, because of the glad assurance that earth's best cannot bear comparison with Heaven's least.<br /> <em>--F. B. M.</em>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It is by no means enough to set out cheerfully with your God on any venture of faith. Tear into smallest pieces any itinerary for the journey which your imagination may have drawn up.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Nothing will fall out as you expect.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Your guide will keep to no beaten path. He will lead you by a way such as you never dreamed your eyes would look upon. He knows no fear, and He expects you to fear nothing while He is with you.

</p>

<p><em>The day had gone; alone and weak</em>

</p>

<p><em>I groped my way within a bleak</em>

</p>

<p><em>And sunless land.</em>

</p>

<p><em>The path that led into the light</em>

</p>

<p><em>I could not find! In that dark</em>

</p>

<p><em>night God took my hand.</em>

</p>

<p><em>He led me that I might not stray,</em>

</p>

<p><em>And brought me by a new, safe way</em>

</p>

<p><em>I had not known.</em>

</p>

<p><em>By waters still, through pastures green</em>

</p>

<p><em>I followed Him--the path was clean</em>

</p>

<p><em>Of briar and stone.</em>

</p>

<p><em>The heavy darkness lost its strength,</em>

</p>

<p><em>My waiting eyes beheld at length</em>

</p>

<p><em>The streaking dawn.</em>

</p>

<p><em>On, safely on, through sunrise glow</em>

</p>

<p><em>I walked, my hand in His, and lo,</em>

</p>

<p><em>The night had gone.</em>

</p>
