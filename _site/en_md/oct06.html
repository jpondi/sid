        <p><em>He opened not his mouth</em> (Isaiah 53:7).

</p>

<p>How much grace it requires to bear a misunderstanding rightly, and to receive an unkind judgment in holy sweetness! Nothing tests the Christian character more than to have some evil thing said about him. This is the file that soon proves whether we are electro-plate or solid gold. If we could only know the blessings that lie hidden in our trials we would say like David, when Shimei cursed him, "Let him curse;... it may be... that the Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day."

</p>

<p>Some people get easily turned aside from the grandeur of their life-work by pursuing their own grievances and enemies, until their life gets turned into one little petty whirl of warfare. It is like a nest of hornets. You may disperse the hornets, but you will probably get terribly stung, and get nothing for your pains, for even their honey is not worth a search.

</p>

<p>God give us more of His Spirit, "who, when he was reviled, reviled not again"; but "committed himself to him that judgeth righteously." "Consider him that endureth such contradiction of sinners against himself."<br /> <em>--A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Before you" He trod all the path of woe,<br /> He took the sharp thrusts with His head bent low.</em>

</p>

<p><em>He knew deepest sorrow and pain and grief,<br /> He knew long endurance without relief,</em>

</p>

<p><em>He took all the bitter from death's deep cup,<br /> He kept not a blood-drop but gave all up.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Before you" and for you, He won the fight<br /> To bring you to glory and realms of light.</em><br /> --L.S.P.
