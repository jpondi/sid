        <p><em>Be ready in the morning, and come... present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. And no man shall come up with thee</em> (Exod. 34:2-3).

</p>

<p>The morning watch is essential. You must not face the day until you have faced God, nor look into the face of others until you have looked into His. You cannot expect to be victorious, if the day begins only in your own strength.

</p>

<p>Face the work of every day with the influence of a few thoughtful, quiet moments with your heart and God. Do not meet other people, even those of your own home, until you have first met the great Guest and honored Companion of your life--Jesus Christ.

</p>

<p>Meet Him alone. Meet Him regularly. Meet Him with His open Book of counsel before you; and face the regular and the irregular duties of each day with the influence of His personality definitely controlling your every act.

</p>

<p><em>Begin the day with God!<br /> He is thy Sun and Day!<br /> His is the radiance of thy dawn;<br /> To Him address thy lay.<br /> Sing a new song at morn!<br /> Join the glad woods and hills;<br /> Join the fresh winds and seas and plains,<br /> Join the bright flowers and rills.<br /> Sing thy first song to God!<br /> Not to thy fellow men;<br /> Not to the creatures of His hand,<br /> But to the glorious One.<br /> Take thy first walk with God!<br /> Let Him go forth with thee;<br /> By stream, or sea, or mountain path,<br /> Seek still His company.<br /> Thy first transaction be<br /> With God Himself above;<br /> So shall thy business prosper well,</em><br /> <em>And all the day be love.</em><br /> --Horatius Bonar

</p>

<p>The men who have done the most for God in this world have been early upon their knees. Matthew Henry used to be in his study at four, and remain there till eight; then, after breakfast and family prayer, he used to be there again till noon; after dinner, he resumed his book or pen till four, and spent the rest of the day in visiting his friends.

</p>

<p>Doddridge himself alludes to his "Family Expositor" as an example of the difference of rising between five and seven, which, in forty years, is nearly equivalent to ten years  more of life.

</p>

<p>Dr. Adam Clark's "Commentary" was chiefly prepared very early in the morning. Barnes' popular and useful "Commentary" has been also the fruit of "early morning hours."

</p>

<p>Simeon's "Sketches" were chiefly worked out between four and eight.
