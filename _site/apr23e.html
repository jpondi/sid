    <h1>🌪 Streams in the Desert - April 23 🌊</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me" ✝️ (Ps. 138:7)</div>
        
        <p>The Hebrew says <span class="highlight">"go on in the center of trouble."</span> What powerful words! We pray in trouble, beg God for help... but no help comes. The enemy keeps attacking until we're right <span class="highlight">in the middle of the battle</span>, in the worst part of our troubles. Why keep asking God for help?</p>
        
        <p>When Martha said, <span class="highlight">"Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn't have died,"</span> Jesus answered her hopelessness with promise: <span class="highlight">"Your brother will rise again."</span> When we're <span class="highlight">"in the center of trouble"</span> like Martha—thinking it's too late for help—God meets us with the same promise: <span class="highlight">"Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me."</span></p>
        
        <p>Even when God's answer seems late... Even when we must keep going through trouble... The <span class="highlight">center of trouble</span> is where God revives us—<span class="highlight">not where He fails us</span>. When all seems hopeless—<span class="highlight">exactly then</span>—God moves against our enemies and finishes what concerns us. Right then, He stops the attacks.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">So why lose heart?</span></p>
        
        <div class="poem">
            <p>🌪 THE EYE OF THE STORM 🌤</p>
            
            <p>Don't fear the whirlwind will sweep you away,<br>
            Don't wait in fear for its coming day,<br>
            Don't shrink from hail that may sting and may flail,<br>
            But move to the storm's heart—through the gale.<br>
            There's shelter warm where the sunlight streams,<br>
            Faith sees her God in the storm's center beams.</p>
            
            <p>🌊 The wild tempest may roar at your door,<br>
            Waves tower like mountains, rains flood and pour,<br>
            Yet the soul stayed on God sings loud and strong,<br>
            For the storm's fierce heart is where calm belongs.</p>
            
            <p>✨ Let hope stay bright through the blackest night,<br>
            Though cyclones may hide all stars from your sight,<br>
            Behind the dark curtain, God's stars still shine,<br>
            His heavenly light will forever be thine.<br>
            Lift up your eyes past the gloom and the harm,<br>
            To God's smiling face—and the sky's blue calm.</p>
            
            <p>🛡 The storm is your shelter from sin and from fear,<br>
            God takes you inside where He holds you near.<br>
            The tempest grows still at His gentle command,<br>
            The howling winds become hymns sweet and grand.<br>
            Rejoice when storm clouds their dark wings unfold—<br>
            God smiles on His child in the storm's eye-hold.</p>
