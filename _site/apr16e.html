            The day had gone; alone and weak<br>
            I groped my way within a bleak<br>
            And sunless land.<br><br>
            
            The path that led into the light<br>
            I could not find! In that dark<br>
            night God took my hand.<br><br>
            
            He led me that I might not stray,<br>
            And brought me by a new, safe way<br>
            I had not known.<br><br>
            
            By waters still, through pastures green<br>
            I followed Him‚Äîthe path was clean<br>
            Of briar and stone.<br><br>
            
            The heavy darkness lost its strength,<br>
            My waiting eyes beheld at length<br>
            The streaking dawn.<br><br>
            
            On, safely on, through sunrise glow<br>
            I walked, my hand in His, and lo,<br>
            The night had gone.
