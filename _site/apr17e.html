        <p class="verse"><i>"The hand of the Lord hath wrought this"</i> (Job 12:9).</p>
        
        <p>Many years ago, workers found the most beautiful diamond ever discovered in an African mine. üíé It was given to the King of England to shine in his crown. The King sent it to Amsterdam to be cut by an expert gem cutter.</p>
        
        <p>What do you think the expert did first? He took this incredibly valuable gem and made a small notch in it. Then he hit it hard with his tool - and the amazing jewel broke in two! üò≤ At first glance, this might seem like a terrible mistake - like he ruined the precious stone.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">But this wasn't an accident. For weeks, the cutter had carefully studied the diamond. He examined its quality, flaws, and natural lines. He was actually one of the most skilled cutters in the world. That "mistake" was actually the most important part of his work!</span> ‚ú®</p>
        
        <p>When he made that cut, he was revealing the diamond's true beauty. From those two pieces came the most magnificent gems - more beautiful than the original uncut stone. The "ruined" diamond actually became more valuable than before!</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Sometimes God allows painful blows to fall on your life. üíî You may bleed, feel hurt, and cry out in pain. The suffering might seem like a terrible mistake. But it's not - because you are God's most precious jewel. And He is the greatest craftsman in the universe.</span></p>
        
        <p>One day, you will shine brightly in God's kingdom. üëë Right now, as He holds you in His hands, He knows exactly how to shape you. Every difficulty you face is allowed by God's love - and He uses each one to bring out blessings and spiritual growth you can't even imagine.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>"Not a single shaft can hit,<br>
            Till the God of love sees fit."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In one of George MacDonald's books, a woman complains: <i>"I don't know why God made me! I can't see any purpose in my life!"</i> üòî</p>
        
        <p>The wise reply came: <i>"Maybe not much yet - but He's not finished with you! He's still making you, and you're fighting against the process."</i></p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">If we could understand that we're being shaped by God - like clay in a potter's hands - and willingly submit to His work, we would eventually welcome even the painful touches. üè∫ We might even see how God is making us into something glorious!</span></p>
