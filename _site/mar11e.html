<h1>Streams in the Desert - March 11 🌅🌄</h1>

<p>After Moses, the Lord’s servant, died, the Lord said to Joshua, son of Nun, Moses’ assistant: <span class="highlight">“Moses my servant is dead. Get ready! Cross the Jordan River! Lead these people into the land which I am ready to hand over to them.”</span> — <span class="italic">Joshua 1:1-2</span></p>

    <p>😢 Sorrow came to you yesterday and emptied your home. Your first thought now is to give up and sit down in despair amid the ruins of your hopes. <span class="bold">But you can’t do that.</span> You are in the middle of a battle, and the crisis is here. To stop even for a moment would put something sacred at risk. Other lives would be hurt if you paused, and holy purposes would suffer if you did nothing. You must not stop, even to grieve. 💔</p>
</div>

<div class="color-line">
    <p>🎖️ A famous general once shared a sad story from his time in war. His son was a lieutenant in charge of a battery. During an attack, the father was leading his troops forward when he saw a dead officer lying on the ground. One look told him it was his son. His first instinct was to stop and mourn, but the battle demanded he keep going. So, after quickly kissing his son’s lifeless lips, he rushed back to lead his men. ⚔️</p>

<div class="color-line">
    <p>🌧️ Crying endlessly beside a grave can’t bring back what you’ve lost, and no good comes from such sadness. Sorrow leaves deep marks; it changes us forever. We never fully recover from our greatest losses; we are never the same after going through them. But if we accept our sorrow and bear it with courage, it can make us kinder and stronger. 🌱</p>
</div>

<div class="color-line">
    <p>🌟 Those who have never suffered are poor in spirit, untouched by sorrow’s lessons. The joy ahead of us should shine on our grief like the sun breaking through clouds, turning them into something beautiful. 🌈 God has arranged it so that by doing our duty, we find the truest comfort. If we sit and dwell on our sadness, the darkness grows and weakens us. But if we turn away from the gloom and take up the tasks God gives us, the light will return, and we will grow stronger. 💪</p>

<p>— J. R. Miller</p>

<div class="color-line">
    <p>🙏 <span class="italic">Thou knowest that through our tears<br>
    Of hasty, selfish weeping<br>
    Comes surer sin, and for our petty fears<br>
    Of loss thou hast in keeping<br>
    A greater gain than all of which we dreamed;<br>
    Thou knowest that in grasping<br>
    The bright possessions which so precious seemed<br>
    We lose them; but if, clasping<br>
    Thy faithful hand, we tread with steadfast feet<br>
    The path of thy appointing,<br>
    There waits for us a treasury of sweet<br>
    Delight, royal anointing<br>
    With oil of gladness and of strength.</span><br>
