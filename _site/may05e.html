            <p>🎶 Don't stop the song in your life<br>
            Though sometimes it may flow<br>
            In sadder tones; it will change again<br>
            To happier ones you know</p>
            
            <p>☁️ Though shadows may darken your skies<br>
            And hide the sun awhile,<br>
            They'll lift more quick if you let music<br>
            Continue through each trial</p>
            
            <p>🎵 Don't stop the song in your life;<br>
            Though your voice may lose its strength,<br>
            Though notes may fade in your throat,<br>
            Keep singing in your soul at length</p>
            
            <p>🌟 Don't stop the song in your life;<br>
            Let it echo in your heart;<br>
            When you pass away, it will follow<br>
            And in heaven take new part</p>
