        <h1>🌵 <b>Streams in the Desert - April 15</b> 🌵</h1>
        
        <div class="verse">
            <i>"I trust in thy word"</i> (Psalms 119:42) 🙏
        </div>
        
        <p>Our <b>faith</b> is strong or weak based on how much we truly believe God will do <i>exactly</i> what He promised. <span class="highlight">✨</span></p>
        
        <p><b>Faith isn't about feelings, impressions, how likely something seems, or what we see with our eyes.</b> If we mix these with faith, we're not really trusting God's Word anymore - because <i>real faith needs none of these things</i>. True faith stands on <b>God's simple promise alone</b>. When we take Him at His Word, our hearts find peace. <span class="highlight">🕊️</span></p>
        
        <p>God <i>loves</i> to grow our faith - first to bless <i>us</i>, then to bless <i>His Church</i>, and finally to bless <i>others</i>. But instead of welcoming this, we often pull back. <span class="highlight">😔</span></p>
        
        <p>When hard times come, we should say: <b>"My Heavenly Father is giving me this difficult cup to drink now, so He can give me something sweet later."</b> <span class="highlight">🍯</span></p>
        
        <p><b>Trials are faith's food.</b> Oh, let's place ourselves completely in our Heavenly Father's hands! <i>Nothing makes Him happier</i> than doing good for His children. <span class="highlight">👨‍👧‍👦</span></p>
        
        <p>But difficulties aren't the only way faith grows. <b>Reading the Bible</b> helps us know God as He's revealed Himself in Scripture. <span class="highlight">📖</span></p>
        
        <p>Can you honestly say, from knowing God, that <i>He is absolutely wonderful</i>? If not, I gently urge you to ask God to show you this - to help you see His <b>gentleness</b> and <b>kindness</b>, until you can declare how <i>good</i> He is, and how much <i>joy</i> He finds in blessing His children. <span class="highlight">💖</span></p>
        
        <p>The closer we get to this truth in our hearts, the more willing we become to <b>trust Him completely</b>, happy with however He works in our lives. Then when trials come, we'll say:</p>
        
        <p><b>"I'll wait and see the good God will bring from this - I know He will!"</b> This kind of faith honors God before the world and <i>strengthens others</i> in their journey. <span class="highlight">🌟</span></p>
