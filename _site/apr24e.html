    <h1>‚ú® True Faith - Streams in the Desert - April 24 ‚ú®</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see" ‚úùÔ∏è (Heb 11:1)</div>
        
        <p>üëâ <span class="highlight">True faith is like mailing a letter - you drop it in the box and let it go.</span> Doubt holds onto a corner of the letter and wonders why no reply comes. üìÆ I have letters in my desk written weeks ago - but because I wasn't sure about the address or content, they're still there. They help no one until I let them go, trusting the mail carrier.</p>

        <p>This is how real faith works. <span class="highlight">It gives our problems to God, and then He acts.</span> Psalm 37:5 says: "Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He will act." But He won't act until we commit. Faith is receiving - better yet, taking - God's offered gifts. We can believe, come, commit, and rest... but we won't fully experience blessings until we start receiving and abiding in Him.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            <p>üìù Dr. Payson wrote to an anxious mother about her son:</p>
            <p>"You worry too much. After praying for him and committing him to God, shouldn't your anxiety stop? üíå The command 'Be anxious for nothing' has no limits - just like 'Cast all your cares on Him.' If we throw our burdens on someone else, can they still weigh us down?</p>
            <p>If we bring worries back from prayer, we didn't truly leave them there. üôè Here's my test: if after giving something to God, I can walk away like Hannah - no longer sad or anxious - that's proof I prayed in faith. But if I carry the burden away, my faith wasn't fully at work."</p>
