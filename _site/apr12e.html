            <b>üå™Ô∏è Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit, but He still faced temptation.</b> Sometimes temptation hits hardest when we're closest to God. As someone wisely said, <span class="highlight">"The devil aims high."</span> He even made one apostle deny knowing Christ!

        <div class="content">
            üî• <span class="highlight">Very few people fought the devil like Martin Luther did. Why?</span> Because Martin Luther was shaking hell's kingdom! And John Bunyan? He faced huge spiritual battles too!

        <div class="content">
            ‚öîÔ∏è <span class="highlight">The more of God's Spirit you have, the bigger your fights with temptation will be.</span> But God allows these tests because they make us stronger - like storms strengthen oak trees, and fire makes pottery designs permanent.

        <div class="content">
            ü§≤ <b>You really discover how tightly you're holding Christ (and He's holding you!) when the devil tries hardest to pull you away.</b> That's when you feel Christ's strong grip on your hand.

            üíé <span class="highlight">Big troubles don't always mean big sins - sometimes they test big faith!</span> God uses sharp tools and rough files to polish His jewels. The ones He loves most get worked on the most, to make them shine brightest.
