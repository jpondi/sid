        <p><em>Look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it </em>(Gen. 13:14-15).

</p>

<p>No instinct can be put in you by the Holy Ghost but He purposes to fulfill. Let your faith then rise and soar away and claim all the land you can discover.<br /> <em>--S. A. Keen</em>

</p>

<p>All you can apprehend in the vision of faith is your own. Look as far as you can, for it is all yours. All that you long to be as a Christian, all that you long to do for God, are within the possibilities of faith. Then come, still closer, and with your Bible before you, and your soul open to all the influences of the Spirit, let your whole being receive the baptism of His presence; and as He opens your understanding to see all His fulness, believe He has it all for you. Accept for yourself all the promises of His word, all the desires He awakens within you, all the possibilities of what you may be as a follower of Jesus. All the land you see is given to you.

</p>

<p>The actual provisions of His grace come from the inner vision. He who puts the instinct in the bosom of yonder bird to cross the continent in search of summer sunshine in the Southern clime is too good to deceive it, and just as surely as He has put the instinct in its breast, so has He also put the balmy breezes and the vernal sunshine yonder to meet it when it arrives.

</p>

<p>He who breathes into our hearts the heavenly hope, will not deceive or fail us when we press forward to its realization.<br /> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p>"And they found as he had said unto them" (Luke 22:13).
