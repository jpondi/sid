<p><em>Though you have allowed me to experience much trouble and distress, revive me once again! Bring me up once again from the depths of the earth!</em> (Ps 71:20)

</p>

<p>God shows us the troubles. Sometimes, as this part of our education is being carried forward, we have to descend into “the lower parts of the earth,” pass through subterranean passages, lie buried amongst the dead, but never for a moment is the cord of fellowship and union between God and us strained to breaking; and from the depths God will bring us again.

</p>

<p>Never doubt God! Never say that He has forsaken or forgotten. Never think that He is unsympathetic. He will quicken again. There is always a smooth piece in every skein, however tangled. The longest day at last rings out the evensong. The winter snow lies long, but it goes at last.

</p>

<p>Be steadfast; your labor is not in vain. God turns again, and comforts. And when He does, the heart which had forgotten its Psalmody breaks out in jubilant song, as does the Psalmist: “I will thank thee, I will harp unto thee, my lips shall sing aloud.”<br /> —<em>Selected</em>

</p>

<p>“Though the rain may fall and the wind be blowing,<br /> And old and chill is the wintry blast;<br /> Though the cloudy sky is still cloudier growing,<br /> And the dead leaves tell that the summer has passed;<br /> My face I hold to the stormy heaven,<br /> My heart is as calm as the summer sea,<br /> Glad to receive what my God has given,<br /> Whate’er it be.<br /> When I feel the cold, I can say, ’He sends it,’<br /> And His winds blow blessing, I surely know;<br /> For I’ve never a want but that He attends it;<br /> And my heart beats warm, though the winds may blow.”
