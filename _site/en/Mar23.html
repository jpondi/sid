        <p><em>Out of the spoils won in battle did they dedicate to maintain the house of the Lord </em>(1 Chron. 26:27).

</p>

<p>Physical force is stored in the bowels of the earth, in the coal mines, which came from the fiery heat that burned up great forests in ancient ages; and so spiritual force is stored in the depths of our being, through the very pain which we cannot understand.

</p>

<p>Some day we shall find that the spoils we have won from our trials were just preparing us to become true "Great Hearts" in the Pilgrim's Progress, and to lead our fellow pilgrims triumphantly through trial to the city of the King.Â But let us never forget that the source of helping other people must be victorious suffering. The whining, murmuring pang never does anybody any good.

</p>

<p>Paul did not carry a cemetery with him, but a chorus of victorious praise; and the harder the trial, the more he trusted and rejoiced, shouting from the very altar of sacrifice. He said, "Yea, and if I be offered upon the service and sacrifice of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all." Lord, help me this day to draw strength from all that comes to me!<br /> <em>--Days of Heaven upon Earth</em>

</p>

<p><em>He placed me in a little cage,</em><br /> <em><em>Away from gardens fair;</em><br /> <em>But I must sing the sweetest songs</em><br /> <em>Because He placed me there.</em><br /> <em>Not beat my wings against the cage</em><br /> <em>If it's my Maker's will,</em><br /> <em>But raise my voice to heaven's gate</em><br /> <em>And sing the louder still!</em></em>
