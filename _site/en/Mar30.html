        <p><em>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow"</em> (Isa. 50:11).

</p>

<p>What a solemn warning to those who walk in darkness and yet who try to help themselves out into the light. They are represented as kindling a fire, and compassing themselves with sparks. What does this mean?

</p>

<p>Why, it means that when we are in darkness the temptation is to find a way without trusting in the Lord and relying upon Him. Instead of letting Him help us out, we try to help ourselves out. We seek the light of nature, and get the advice of our friends. We try the conclusions of our reason, and might almost be tempted to accept a way of deliverance which would not be of God at all.

</p>

<p>All these are fires of our own kindling; rushlights that will surely lead us onto the shoals. And God will let us walk in the light of those sparks, but the end will be sorrow.

</p>

<p>Beloved, do not try to get out of a dark place, except, in God's time and in God's way. The time of trouble is meant to teach you lessons that you sorely need.Â Premature deliverance may frustrate God's work of grace in your life. Just commit the whole situation to Him. Be willing to abide in darkness so long as you have His presence.

</p>

<p>Remember that it is better to walk in the dark with God than to walk alone in the light.<br /> <em>--The Still Small Voice</em>

</p>

<p>Cease meddling with God's plans and will. You touch anything of His, and you mar the work. You may move the hands of a clock to suit you, but you do not change the time; so you may hurry the unfolding of God's will, but you harm and do not help the work. You can open a rosebud but you spoil the flower. Leave all to Him. Hands down. Thy will, not mine.<br /> <em>--Stephen Merritt</em>

</p>

<p><strong>HIS WAY</strong>

</p>

<p><em>God bade me go when I would stay<br /> ('Twas cool within the wood);<br /> I did not know the reason why.<br /> I heard a boulder crashing by<br /> Across the path where I stood.<br /> He bade me stay when I would go;<br /> "Thy will be done," I said.<br /> They found one day at early dawn,<br /> Across the way I would have gone,<br /> A serpent with a mangled head.<br /> No more I ask the reason why,<br /> Although I may not see<br /> The path ahead, His way I go;<br /> For though I know not, He doth know,</em><br /> <em>And He will choose safe paths for me.</em><br /> --The Sunday School Times
