        <p><em>Therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you</em> (Isa. 30:18).

</p>

<p>Where showers fall most, there the grass is greenest. I suppose the fogs and mists of Ireland make it "the Emerald Isle"; and whenever you find great fogs of trouble, and mists of sorrow, you always find emerald green hearts; full of the beautiful verdure of the comfort and love of God.

</p>

<p>O Christian, do not thou be saying, "Where are the swallows gone? They are gone; they are dead." They are not dead; they have skimmed the purple sea, and gone to a far-off land; but they will be back again by and by.

</p>

<p>Child of God, say not the flowers are dead; say not the winter has killed them, and they are gone. Ah, no! though winter hath coated them with the ermine of its snow; they will put up their heads again, and will be alive very soon.

</p>

<p>Say not, child of God, that the sun is quenched, because the cloud hath hidden it. Ah, no; he is behind there, brewing summer for thee; for when he cometh out again, he will have made the clouds fit to drop in April showers, all of them mothers of the sweet May flowers.

</p>

<p>And oh! above all, when thy God hides His face, say not that He hath forgotten thee. He is but tarrying a little while to make thee love Him better; and when He cometh, thou shalt have joy in the Lord, and shalt rejoice with joy unspeakable. Waiting exercises our grace; waiting tries our faith; therefore, wait on in hope; for though the promise tarry, it can never come too late. Â <br /> <em>--C. H. Spurgeon</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Oh, every year hath its winter,<br /> And every year hath its rain--<br /> But a day is always coming<br /> When the birds go north again.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"When new leaves swell in the forest,<br /> And grass springs green on the plain,<br /> And alders' veins turn crimson--<br /> And the birds go north again.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"Oh, every heart hath its sorrow,<br /> And every heart hath its pain--<br /> But a day is always coming<br /> When the birds go north again.</em>

</p>

<p><em>"'Tis the sweetest thing to remember,<br /> If courage be on the wane,<br /> When the cold, dark days are over--<br /> Why, the birds go north again."</em>
