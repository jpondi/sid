        <p><em>“Bring them here to me,” he replied.</em> (Matt 14:18)

</p>

<p>Are you encompassed with needs at this very moment, and almost overwhelmed with difficulties, trials, and emergencies? These are all divinely provided vessels for the Holy Spirit to fill, and if you but rightly understood their meaning, they would become opportunities for receiving new blessings and deliverances which you can get in no other way.

</p>

<p>Bring these vessels to God. Hold them steadily before Him in faith and prayer. Keep still, and stop your own restless working until He begins to work. Do nothing that He does not Himself command you to do. Give Him a chance to work, and He will surely do so; and the very trials that threatened to overcome you with discouragement and disaster, will become God’s opportunity for the revelation of His grace and glory in your life, as you have never known Him before. “Bring them (all needs) to me.”<br /> <em>—A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p>“My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:19).

</p>

<p>What a source—“God!” What a supply—“His riches in glory!” What a channel—“Christ Jesus!” It is your sweet privilege to place all your need over against His riches, and lose sight of the former in the presence of the latter. His exhaustless treasury is thrown open to you, in all the love of His heart; go and draw upon it, in the artless simplicity of faith, and you will never have occasion to look to a creature-stream, or lean on a creature-prop.<br /> <em>—C. H. M.</em>

</p>

<p>“MY CUP RUNNETH OVER”

</p>

<p><em>There is always something over,</em><br /> <em>When we trust our gracious Lord;</em><br /> <em>Every cup He fills o’erfloweth,</em><br /> <em>His great rivers all are broad.</em><br /> <em>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,</em><br /> <em>Ever issues from His store;</em><br /> <em>To His own He gives full measure,</em><br /> <em>Running over, evermore.</em>

</p>

<p><em>There is always something over,</em><br /> <em>When we, from the Father’s hand,</em><br /> <em>Take our portion with thanksgiving,</em><br /> <em>Praising for the path He planned.</em><br /> <em>Satisfaction, full and deepening,</em><br /> <em>Fills the soul, and lights the eye,</em><br /> <em>When the heart has trusted Jesus</em><br /> <em>All its need to satisfy.</em>

</p>

<p><em>There is always something over,</em><br /> <em>When we tell of all His love;</em><br /> <em>Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,</em><br /> <em>Unsealed heights rise far above:</em><br /> <em>Human lips can never utter</em><br /> <em>All His wondrous tenderness,</em><br /> <em>We can only praise and wonder,</em><br /> <em>And His name forever bless.</em><br /> —Margaret E. Barber

</p>

<p>“How can He but, in giving Him, lavish on us all things” (Rom. 8:32).
