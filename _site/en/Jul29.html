        <p><em>Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the day of trouble?</em> (Job 38:22-23).

</p>

<p>Our trials are great opportunities. Too often we look on them as great obstacles. It would be a haven of rest and an inspiration of unspeakable power if each of us would henceforth recognize every difficult situation as one of God's chosen ways of proving to us His love and look around for the signals of His glorious manifestations; then, indeed, would every cloud become a rainbow, and every mountain a path of ascension and a scene of transfiguration.

</p>

<p>If we will look back upon the past, many of us will find that the very time our Heavenly Father has chosen to do the kindest things for us, and given us the richest blessings, has been the time we were strained and shut in on every side.

</p>

<p>God's jewels are often sent us in rough packages and by dark liveried servants, but within we find the very treasures of the King's palace and the Bridegroom's love.<br /> <em>--A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p>Trust Him in the dark, honor Him with unwavering confidence even in the midst of mysterious dispensations, and the recompense of such faith will be like the moulting of the eagle's plumes, which was said to give them a new lease of youth and strength.<br /> <em>--J. R. Macduff</em>

</p>

<p><em>If we could see beyond today</em><br /> <em><em>As God can see;</em><br /> <em>If all the clouds should roll away,</em><br /> <em>The shadows flee;</em><br /> <em>O'er present griefs we would not fret.</em><br /> <em>Each sorrow we would soon forget,</em><br /> <em>For many joys are waiting yet</em><br /> <em>For you and me.</em><br /> <em>If we could know beyond today</em><br /> <em>As God doth know,</em><br /> <em>Why dearest treasures pass away</em><br /> <em>And tears must flow;</em><br /> <em>And why the darkness leads to light,</em><br /> <em>Why dreary paths will soon grow bright;</em><br /> <em>Some day life's wrongs will be made right,</em><br /> <em>Faith tells us so.</em><br /> <em>"If we could see, if we could know,"</em><br /> <em>We often say,</em><br /> <em>But God in love a veil doth throw</em><br /> <em>Across our way;</em><br /> <em>We cannot see what lies before,</em><br /> <em>And so we cling to Him the more,</em><br /> <em>He leads us till this life is o'er;</em><br /> <em>Trust and obey.</em></em>
