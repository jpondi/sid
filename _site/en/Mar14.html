        <p><em>The people kept their distance, but Moses drew near the thick darkness where God was. (Exod 20:21)</em>

</p>

<p>God has still His hidden secrets, hidden from the wise and prudent. Do not fear them; be content to accept things that you cannot understand; wait patiently. Presently He will reveal to you the treasures of darkness, the riches of the glory of the mystery. Mystery is only the veil of God’s face.

</p>

<p>Do not be afraid to enter the cloud that is settling down on your life. God is in it. The other side is radiant with His glory. “Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you; but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings.” When you seem loneliest and most forsaken, God is nigh. He is in the dark cloud. Plunge into the blackness of its darkness without flinching; under the shrouding curtain of His pavilion you will find God awaiting you.<br /> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Hast thou a cloud?</em><br /> <em><em>Something that is dark and full of dread;</em><br /> <em>A messenger of tempest overhead?</em><br /> <em>A something that is darkening the sky;</em><br /> <em>A something growing darker bye and bye;</em><br /> <em>A something that thou fear’st will burst at last;</em><br /> <em>A cloud that doth a deep, long shadow cast,</em><br /> <em>God cometh in that cloud.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Hast thou a cloud?</em><br /> <em><em>It is Jehovah’s triumph car: in this</em><br /> <em>He rideth to thee, o’er the wide abyss.</em><br /> <em>It is the robe in which He wraps His form;</em><br /> <em>For He doth gird Him with the flashing storm.</em><br /> <em>It is the veil in which He hides the light</em><br /> <em>Of His fair face, too dazzling for thy sight.</em><br /> <em>God cometh in that cloud.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Hast thou a cloud?</em><br /> <em><em>A trial that is terrible to thee?</em><br /> <em>A black temptation threatening to see?</em><br /> <em>A loss of some dear one long thine own?</em><br /> <em>A mist, a veiling, bringing the unknown?</em><br /> <em>A mystery that unsubstantial seems:</em><br /> <em>A cloud between thee and the sun’s bright beams?</em><br /> <em>God cometh in that cloud.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Hast thou a cloud?</em><br /> <em><em>A sickness—weak old age—distress and death?</em><br /> <em>These clouds will scatter at thy last faint breath.</em><br /> <em>Fear not the clouds that hover o’er thy barque,</em><br /> <em>Making the harbour’s entrance dire and dark;</em><br /> <em>The cloud of death, though misty, chill and cold,</em><br /> <em>Will yet grow radiant with a fringe of gold.</em><br /> <em>GOD cometh in that cloud.”</em></em>

</p>

<p>As Dr. C. stood on a high peak of the Rocky Mountains watching a storm raging below him, an eagle came up through the clouds, and soared away towards the sun and the water upon him glistened in the sunlight like diamonds. Had it not been for the storm he might have remained in the valley. The sorrows of life cause us to rise towards God.
