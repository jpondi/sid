<p><em>Thou makest the outgoing of the morning and evening to rejoice</em> (Ps. 65:8).

</p>

<p>Get up early and go to the mountain and watch God make a morning. The dull gray will give way as God pushes the sun towards the horizon, and there will be tints and hues of every shade, that will blend into one perfect light as the full-orbed sun bursts into view. As the King of day moves forth majestically, flooding the earth and every lowly vale, listen to the music of heaven's choir as it sings of the majesty of God and the glory of the morning.

</p>

<p>In the holy hush of the early dawn<br /> I hear a Voice<br /> "I am with you all the day,<br /> Rejoice! Rejoice!"

</p>

<p>The clear, pure light of the morning made me long for the truth in my heart, which alone could make me pure and clear as the morning, tune me up to the concert-pitch of the nature around me. And the wind that blew from the sunrise made me hope in the God who had first breathed into my nostrils the breath of life; that He would at length so fill me with His breath, His mind, His Spirit, that I should think only His thoughts, and live His life, finding therein my own life, only glorified infinitely.

</p>

<p>What should we poor humans do without our God's nights and mornings?<br /> --<em>George MacDonald</em>

</p>

<p>"In the early morning hours,<br /> 'Twixt the night and day,<br /> While from earth the darkness passes<br /> Silently away;<br /> "Then 'tis sweet to talk with Jesus<br /> In thy chamber still<br /> For the coming day and duties<br /> Ask to know His will.<br /> "Then He'll lead the way before you,<br /> Mountains laying low;<br /> Making desert places blossom,<br /> Sweet'ning Marah's flow.<br /> "Would you know this life of triumph,<br /> Victory all the way?<br /> Then put God in the beginning<br /> Of each coming day."
