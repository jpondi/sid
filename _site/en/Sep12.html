        <p><br /> <em>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?"</em> (S. of Sol. 8:5).

</p>

<p>Some one gained a good lesson from a Southern prayer meeting. A brother asked the Lord for various blessings--as you and I do, and thanked the Lord for many already received--as you and I do; but he closed with this unusual petition: "And, O Lord, support us! Yes support us Lord on every leanin' side!"

</p>

<p>Have you any leaning sides? This humble man's prayer pictures them in a new way and shows the Great Supporter in a new light also. He is always walking by the Christian, ready to extend His mighty arm and steady the weak one on "every leanin' side."

</p>

<p><em>"Child of My love, lean hard,<br /> And let Me feel the pressure of thy care;<br /> I know thy burden, child. I shaped it;<br /> Poised it in Mine Own hand; made no proportion<br /> In its weight to thine unaided strength,<br /> For even as I laid it on, I said,<br /> 'I shall be near, and while she leans on Me,<br /> This burden shall be Mine, not hers;<br /> So shall I keep My child within the circling arms<br /> Of My Own love.'<br /> Here lay it down, nor fear<br /> To impose it on a shoulder which upholds the government of worlds.<br /> Yet closer come: Thou art not near enough.<br /> I would embrace thy care;<br /> So I might feel My child reposing on My breast.<br /> Thou lovest Me? I knew it.<br /> Doubt not then;<br /> But Loving Me, lean hard."</em>
