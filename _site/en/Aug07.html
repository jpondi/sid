<p>Christmas Evans tells us in his diary that one Sunday afternoon he was traveling a very lonely road to attend an appointment, and he was convicted of a cold heart. He says,

</p>

<p>"I tethered my horse and went to a sequestered spot, where I walked to and fro in an agony as I reviewed my life. I waited three hours before God, broken with sorrow, until there broke over me a sweet sense of His forgiving love. I received from God a new baptism of the Holy Ghost.

</p>

<p>As the sun was westering, I went back to the road, found my horse, mounted it and went to my appointment. On the following day I preached with such new power to a vast concourse of people gathered on the hillside, that a revival broke out that day and spread through all Wales."

</p>

<p>The greatest question that can be asked of the "twice born" ones is, "Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?" This was the password into the early Church.

</p>

<p><em>O the Spirit filled life; is it thine, is it thine?<br /> Is thy soul wholly filled with the Spirit Divine?<br /> O thou child of the King, has He fallen on thee?<br /> Does He reign in thy soul, so that all men may see<br /> The dear Savior's blest image reflected in thee?<br /> Has He swept through thy soul like the waves of the sea?<br /> Does the Spirit of God daily rest upon thee?<br /> Does He sweeten thy life, does He keep thee from care?<br /> Does He guide thee and bless thee in answer to prayer?<br /> Is it joy to be led of the Lord anywhere?<br /> Is He near thee each hour, does He stand at thy side?<br /> Does He gird thee with strength, has He come to abide?<br /> Does He give thee to know that all things may be done<br /> Through the grace and the power of the Crucified One?<br /> Does He witness to thee of the glorified Son?<br /> Has He purged thee of dross with the fire from above?<br /> Is He first in thy thoughts, has He all of thy love?<br /> Is His service thy choice, and is sacrifice sweet?<br /> Is the doing His will both thy drink and thy meat?<br /> Dost thou run at His bidding with glad eager feet?<br /> Has He freed thee from self and from all of thy greed?<br /> Dost thou hasten to succor thy brother in need?<br /> As a soldier of Christ dost thou hardness endure?<br /> Is thy hope in the Lord everlasting and sure?<br /> Hast thou patience and meekness, art tender and pure?<br /> O the Spirit filled life may be thine, may be thine,<br /> In thy soul evermore the Shekinah may shine;<br /> It is thine to live with the tempests all stilled,<br /> It is thine with the blessed Holy Ghost to be filled;<br /> It is thine, even thine, for thy Lord has so willed.</em>
