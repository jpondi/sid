<p><em>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith</em> (1 John 5:4).

</p>

<p><em>It is easy to love Him when the blue is in the sky,</em><br /><em><em>When summer winds are blowing, and we smell the roses nigh;</em> <br /> <em>There is little effort needed to obey His precious will</em> <br /> <em>When it leads through flower-decked valley, or over sun-kissed hill.</em> </em>

</p>

<p><em><em>It is when the rain is falling, or the mist hangs in the air,</em> <br /> <em>When the road is dark and rugged, and the wind no longer fair,</em> <br /> <em>When the rosy dawn has settled in a shadowland of gray,</em> <br /> <em>That we find it hard to trust Him, and are slower to obey.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em><em>It is easy to trust Him when the singing birds have come,</em> <br /> <em>And their canticles are echoed in our heart and in our home;</em> <br /> <em>But 'tis when we miss the music, and the days are dull and drear,</em> <br /> <em>That we need a faith triumphant over every doubt and fear.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em><em>And our blessed Lord will give it; what we lack He will supply;</em> <br /> <em>Let us ask in faith believing--on His promises rely;</em> <br /> <em>He will ever be our Leader, whether smooth or rough the way,</em> <br /> <em>And will prove Himself sufficient for the needs of every day.</em></em>

</p>

<p>To trust in spite of the look of being forsaken; to keep crying out into the vast, whence comes no returning voice, and where seems no hearing; to see the machinery of the world pauselessly grinding on as if self-moved, caring for no life, nor shifting a hair-breadth for all entreaty, and yet believe that God is awake and utterly loving; to desire nothing but what comes meant for us from His hand; to wait patiently, ready to die of hunger, fearing only lest faith should fail--such is the victory that overcometh the world, such is faith indeed.<br /><em>--George MacDonald</em>
