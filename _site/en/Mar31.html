        <p><em>The wind was contrary</em> (Matt. 14:24).

</p>

<p>Rude and blustering the winds of March often are. Do they not typify the tempestuous seasons of my life? But, indeed, I ought to be glad that I make acquaintance with these seasons. Better it is that the rains descend and the floods come than that I should stay perpetually in the Lotus Land where it seems always afternoon, or in that deep meadowed Valley of Avilion where never wind blows loudly. Storms of temptation appear cruel, but do they not give intenser earnestness to prayer? Do they not compel me to seize the promises with a tighter hand grip? Do they not leave me with a character refined?

</p>

<p>Storms of bereavement are keen; but, then, they are one of the Father's ways of driving me to Himself, that in the secret of His presence His voice may speak to my heart, soft and low. There is a glory of the Master which can be seen only when the wind is contrary and the ship tossed with waves.

</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ is no security against storms, but He is perfect security in storms. He has never promised you an easy passage, only a safe landing."

</p>

<p><em>Oh, set your sail to the heavenly gale,<br /> And then, no matter what winds prevail,<br /> No reef can wreck you, no calm delay;<br /> No mist shall hinder, no storm shall stay;<br /> Though far you wander and long you roam<br /> Through salt sea sprays and o'er white sea foam,</em><br /> <em>No wind that can blow but shall speed you Home.</em><br /> --Annie Johnson Flint
