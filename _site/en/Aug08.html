        <p><br /> <em>You are my king, O God! Decree Jacob’s deliverance!</em> (Ps 44:4)

</p>

<p>Here is no foe to your growth in grace, no enemy in your Christian work, which was not included in your Savior’s conquests.

</p>

<p>You need not be afraid of them. When you touch them, they will flee before you. God has promised to deliver them up before you. Only be strong and very courageous! Fear not, nor be dismayed! The Lord is with you, O mighty men of valor—mighty because one with the Mightiest. Claim victory!

</p>

<p>Whenever your enemies close in upon you, claim victory! Whenever heart and flesh fail, look up and claim VICTORY!

</p>

<p>Be sure that you have a share in that triumph which Jesus won, not for Himself alone, but for us all; remember that you were in Him when He won it, and claim victory!

</p>

<p>Reckon that it is yours, and gather spoil. Neither the Anakim nor fenced cities need daunt or abash you. You are one of the conquering legion. Claim your share in the Savior’s victory.<br /> <em>—Joshua, by Meyer</em>

</p>

<p>We are children of the King. In which way do we most honor our Divine Sovereign, by failing to claim our rights and even doubting whether they belong to us, or by asserting our privilege as children of the Royal Family and demanding the rights which belong to our heirship?
