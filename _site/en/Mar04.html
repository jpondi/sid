        <p><em>Followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises</em> (Heb. 6:12).

</p>

<p>They (heroes of faith) are calling to us from the heights that they have won, and telling us that what man once did man can do again. Not only do they remind us of the necessity of faith, but also of that patience by which faith has its perfect work. Let us fear to take ourselves out of the hands of our heavenly Guide or to miss a single lesson of His loving discipline by discouragement or doubt.

</p>

<p>"There is only one thing," said a village blacksmith, "that I fear, and that is to be thrown on the scrap heap.Â "When I am tempering a piece of steel, I first beat it, hammer it, and then suddenly plunge it into this bucket of cold water. I very soon find whether it will take temper or go to pieces in the process. When I discover after one or two tests that it is not going to allow itself to be tempered, I throw it on the scrap heap and sell it for a cent a pound when the junk man comes around.

</p>

<p>"So I find the Lord tests me, too, by fire and water and heavy blows of His heavy hammer, and if I am not willing to stand the test, or am not going to prove a fit subject for His tempering process, I am afraid He may throw me on the scrap heap."

</p>

<p>When the fire is hottest, hold still, for there will be a blessed "afterward"; and with Job we may be able to say, "When he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold."<br /> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p>Sainthood springs out of suffering. It takes eleven tons of pressure on a piano to tune it. God will tune you to harmonize with Heaven's key-note if you can stand the strain.

</p>

<p><em>Things that hurt and things that mar<br /> Shape the man for perfect praise;<br /> Shock and strain and ruin are<br /> Friendlier than the smiling days.</em>
