        <p><em>"Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar"</em> (Psalms 118:27).

</p>

<p>Is not this altar inviting thee? Shall we not ask to be bound to it, that we may never be able to start back from our attitude of consecration? There are times when life is full of roseate light, and we choose the Cross; at other times, when the sky is grey, we shrink from it. It is well to be bound.

</p>

<p>Wilt Thou bind us, most blessed Spirit, and enamor us with the Cross, and let us never leave it? Bind us with the scarlet cord of redemption, and the golden cord of love, and the silver cord of Advent-hope, so we will not go back from it, or wish for another lot than to be the humble partners with our Lord in His pain and sorrow!

</p>

<p>The horns of the altar invite thee. Wilt thou come? Wilt thou dwell ever in a spirit of resigned humility, and give thyself wholly to the Lord?<br /> --<em>Selected</em>

</p>

<p>The story is told of a colored brother who, at a camp meeting, tried to give himself to God. Every night at the altar he consecrated himself; but every night before he left the meeting, the devil would come to him and convince him that he did not feel any different and therefore he was not consecrated.

</p>

<p>Again and again he was beaten back by the adversary. Finally, one evening he came to the meeting with an axe and a big stake. After consecrating himself, he drove the stake into the ground just where he had knelt. As he was leaving the building, the devil came to him as usual and tried to make him believe that it was all a farce. At once he went back to the stake and, pointing to it, said, "Look here, Mr. Devil, do you see that stake? Well, that's my witness that God has forever accepted me."

</p>

<p>Immediately the devil left him, and he had no further doubts on the subject.<br /> --<em>The Still Small Voice</em>

</p>

<p>Beloved, if you are tempted to doubt the finality of your consecration, drive a stake down somewhere and let it be your witness before God and even the devil that you have settled the question forever.

</p>

<p><em>Are you groping for a blessing,</em><br /> <em><em>Never getting there?</em><br /> <em>Listen to a word in season,</em><br /> <em>Get somewhere.</em><br /> <em>Are you struggling for salvation</em><br /> <em>By your anxious prayer?</em><br /> <em>Stop your struggling, simply trust, and--</em><br /> <em>Get somewhere.</em><br /> <em>Does the answer seem to linger</em><br /> <em>To your earnest prayer?</em><br /> <em>Turn your praying into praise, and--</em><br /> <em>Get somewhere.</em><br /> <em>You will never know His fulness</em><br /> <em>Till you boldly dare</em><br /> <em>To commit your all to Him, and--</em><br /> <em>Get somewhere.</em></em><br /> --Songs of the Spirit Trust in Spite of How it Looks
