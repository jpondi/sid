        <p><em>Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well, sing to it!</em> (Num 21:17)

</p>

<p>This was a strange song and a strange well. They had been traveling over the desert’s barren sands, no water was in sight and they were famishing with thirst. Then God spake to Moses and said:

</p>

<p>“Gather the people together, and I will give them water,” and this is how it came.

</p>

<p>They gathered in circles on the sands. They took their staves and dug deep down into the burning earth and as they dug, they sang,

</p>

<p>“Spring up, O well, sing ye unto it,” and lo, there came a gurgling sound, a rush of water and a flowing stream which filled the well and ran along the ground.

</p>

<p>When they dug this well in the desert, they touched the stream that was running beneath, and reached the flowing tides that had long been out of sight.

</p>

<p>How beautiful the picture given, telling us of the river of blessing that flows all through our lives, and we have only to reach by faith and praise to find our wants supplied in the most barren desert.

</p>

<p>How did they reach the waters of this well? It was by praise. They sang upon the sand their song of faith, while with their staff of promise they dug the well.

</p>

<p>Our praise will still open fountains in the desert, when murmuring will only bring us judgment, and even prayer may fail to reach the fountains of blessing.

</p>

<p>There is nothing that pleases the Lord so much as praise. There is no test of faith so true as the grace of thanksgiving. Are you praising God enough? Are you thanking Him for your actual blessings that are more than can be numbered, and are you daring to praise Him even for those trials which are but blessings in disguise? Have you learned to praise Him in advance for the things that have not yet come?<br /> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Thou waitest for deliverance!</em><br /> <em>O soul, thou waitest long!</em><br /> <em>Believe that now deliverance</em><br /> <em>Doth wait for thee in song!</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Sigh not until deliverance</em><br /> <em>Thy fettered feet doth free:</em><br /> <em>With songs of glad deliverance</em><br /> <em>God now doth compass thee.”</em>
