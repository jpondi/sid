        <p><em>Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts</em> (Zech. 4:6).

</p>

<p>My way led up a hill, and right at the foot I saw a boy on a bicycle. He was pedalling up hill against the wind, and evidently found it a tremendously hard work. Just as he was working most strenuously and doing his best painfully, there came a trolley car going in the same direction--up the hill.

</p>

<p>It was not going too fast for the boy to get behind it, and with one hand to lay hold of the bar at the back. Then you know what happened. He went up that hill like a bird. Then it flashed upon me:

</p>

<p>"Why, I am like that boy on the bicycle in my weariness and weakness. I am pedalling up hill against all kinds of opposition, and am almost worn out with the task. But here at hand is a great available power, the strength of the Lord Jesus.

</p>

<p>"I have only to get in touch with Him and to maintain communication with Him, though it may be only one little finger of faith, and that will be enough to make His power mine for the doing of this bit of service that just now seems too much for me." And I was helped to dismiss my weariness and to realize this truth.<br /> <em>--The Life of Fuller Purpose</em>

</p>

<p><strong>ABANDONED</strong>

</p>

<p><em>Utterly abandoned to the Holy Ghost!</em><br /> <em>Seeking all His fulness at whatever cost;</em><br /> <em>Cutting all the shore-lines, launching in the deep</em><br /> <em>Of His mighty power--strong to save and keep.</em><br /> <em>Utterly abandoned to the Holy Ghost!</em><br /> <em>Oh! the sinking, sinking, until self is lost!</em><br /> <em>Until the emptied vessel lies broken at His feet;</em><br /> <em>Waiting till His filling shall make the work complete.</em><br /> <em>Utterly abandoned to the will of God;</em><br /> <em>Seeking for no other path than my Master trod;</em><br /> <em>Leaving ease and pleasure, making Him my choice,</em><br /> <em>Waiting for His guidance, listening for His voice.</em><br /> <em>Utterly abandoned! no will of my own;</em><br /> <em>For time and for eternity, His, and His alone;</em><br /> <em>All my plans and purposes lost in His sweet will,</em><br /> <em>Having nothing, yet in Him all things possessing still.</em><br /> <em>Utterly abandoned! 'tis so sweet to be</em><br /> <em>Captive in His bonds of love, yet so wondrous free;</em><br /> <em>Free from sin's entanglements, free from doubt and fear,</em><br /> <em>Free from every worry, burden, grief or care.</em><br /> <em>Utterly abandoned! oh, the rest is sweet,</em><br /> <em>As I tarry, waiting, at His blessed feet;</em><br /> <em>Waiting for the coming of the Guest divine,</em><br /> <em>Who my inmost being shall perfectly refine.</em><br /> <em>Lo! He comes and fills me, Holy Spirit sweet!</em><br /> <em>I, in Him, am satisfied! I, in Him, complete!</em><br /> <em>And the light within my soul shall nevermore grow dim</em><br /> <em>While I keep my covenant--abandoned unto Him!</em><br /> --Author Unknown
