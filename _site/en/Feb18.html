        <p><em>Have faith that whatever you ask for in prayer is already granted you, and you will find that it will be (</em>Mark 11:24<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>When my little son was about ten years of age, his grandmother promised him a stamp album for Christmas. Christmas came, but no stamp album, and no word from grandmother. The matter, however, was not mentioned; but when his playmates came to see his Christmas presents, I was astonished, after he had named over this and that as gifts received, to hear him add, "And a stamp album from grandmother."

</p>

<p>I had heard it several times, when I called him to me, and said, "But, Georgie, you did not get an album from your grandmother. Why do you say so?"

</p>

<p>There was a wondering look on his face, as if he thought it strange that I should ask such a question, and he replied, "Well,  mamma, grandma said, so it is the same as." I could not say a word to check his faith.

</p>

<p>A month went by, and nothing was heard from the album. Finally, one day, I said, to test his faith, and really wondering in my heart why the album had not been sent, "Well, Georgie, I think grandma has forgotten her promise."

</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mamma," he quickly and firmly said, "she hasn't."

</p>

<p>I watched the dear, trusting face, which, for a while, looked very sober, as if debating the possibilities I had suggested. Finally a bright light passed over it, and he said, "Mamma, do you think it would do any good if I should write to her thanking her for the album?"

</p>

<p>"I do not know," I said, "but you might try it." A rich spiritual truth began to dawn upon me.

</p>

<p>In a few minutes a letter was prepared and committed to the mail, and he went off whistling his confidence in his grandma. In just a short time a letter came, saying:

</p>

<p style="margin-left:40px">"My dear Georgie: I have not forgotten my promise to you, of an album. I tried to get such a book as you desired, but could not get the sort you wanted; so I sent on to New York. It did not get here till after Christmas, and it was still not right, so I sent for another, and as it has not come as yet, I send you three dollars to get one in Chicago. Your loving grandma."

</p>

<p>As he read the letter, his face was the face of a victor. "Now, mamma, didn't I tell you?" came from the depths of a heart that never doubted, that, "against hope, believed in hope" that the stamp album would come. While he was trusting, grandma was working, and in due season faith became sight.

</p>

<p>It is so human to want sight when we step out on the promises of God, but our Savior said to Thomas, and to the long roll of doubters who have ever since followed him: "Blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed."<br /> <em>--Mrs. Rounds</em>
