        <p><em>Be thou there till I bring thee word</em> (Matt. 2:13).

</p>

<p><em>I'll stay where You've put me;<br /> I will, dear Lord, Though I wanted so badly to go;<br /> I was eager to march with the 'rank and file,'<br /> Yes, I wanted to lead them, You know.<br /> I planned to keep step to the music loud,<br /> To cheer when the banner unfurled,<br /> To stand in the midst of the fight straight and proud,<br /> But I'll stay where You've put me.<br /> I'll stay where You've put me; I'll work, dear Lord,<br /> Though the field be narrow and small,<br /> And the ground be fallow, and the stones lie thick,<br /> And there seems to be no life at all.<br /> The field is Thine own, only give me the seed,<br /> I'll sow it with never a fear;<br /> I'll till the dry soil while I wait for the rain,<br /> And rejoice when the green blades appear;<br /> I'll work where You've put me.<br /> I'll stay where You've put me; I will, dear Lord;<br /> I'll bear the day's burden and heat,<br /> Always trusting Thee fully; when even has come<br /> I'll lay heavy sheaves at Thy feet.<br /> And then, when my earth work is ended and done,<br /> In the light of eternity's glow,<br /> Life's record all closed, I surely shall find<br /> It was better to stay than to go;<br /> I'll stay where You've put me.</em>

</p>

<p>Oh restless heart, that beat against your prison bars of circumstances, yearning for a wider sphere of usefulness, leave God to order all your days. Patience and trust, in the dullness of the routine of life, will be the best preparation for a courageous bearing of the tug and strain of the larger opportunity which God may some time send you.
