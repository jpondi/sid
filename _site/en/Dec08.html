        <p><br /> <em>Put on as the elect of God, kindness</em> (Colossians 3:12).

</p>

<p>There is a story of an old man who carried a little can of oil with him everywhere he went, and if he passed through a door that squeaked, he poured a little oil on the hinges. If a gate was hard to open, he oiled the latch. And thus he passed through life lubricating all hard places and making it easier for those who came after him. People called him eccentric, queer, and cranky; but the old man went steadily on refilling his can of oil when it became empty, and oiled the hard places he found.

</p>

<p>There are many lives that creak and grate harshly as they live day by day. Nothing goes right with them. They need lubricating with the oil of gladness, gentleness, or thoughtfulness.

</p>

<p>Have you your own can of oil with you? Be ready with your oil of helpfulness in the early morning to the one nearest you. It may lubricate the whole day for him. The oil, of good cheer to the downhearted one--Oh, how much it may mean! The word of courage to the despairing. Speak it. Our lives touch others but once, perhaps, on the road of life; and then, mayhap, our ways diverge, never to meet again.

</p>

<p>The oil of kindness has worn the sharp, hard edges off of many a sin-hardened life and left it soft and pliable and ready for the redeeming grace of the Saviour. A word spoken pleasantly is a large spot of sunshine on a sad heart. Therefore, "Give others the sunshine, tell Jesus the rest."

</p>

<p><em>We cannot know the grief<br /> That men may borrow;<br /> We cannot see the souls<br /> Storm-swept by sorrow;<br /> But love can shine upon the way<br /> Today, tomorrow;<br /> Let us be kind.<br /> Upon the wheel of pain so many weary lives are broken,<br /> We live in vain who give no tender token.<br /> Let us be kind.</em>

</p>

<p>"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love" (Romans 12:10).
