        <p><em>We walk by faith, not by appearance</em> (2 Cor. 5:7, RV).

</p>

<p>By faith, not appearance; God never wants us to look at our feelings. Self may want us to; and Satan may want us to. But God wants us to face facts, not feelings; the facts of Christ and of His finished and perfect work for us.

</p>

<p>When we face these precious facts, and believe them because God says they are facts, God will take care of our feelings.

</p>

<p>God never gives feeling to enable us to trust Him; God never gives feeling to encourage us to trust Him; God never gives feeling to show that we have already and utterly trusted Him. God gives feeling only when He sees that we trust Him apart from all feeling, resting on His own Word, and on His own faithfulness to His promise. Never until then can the feeling (which is from God) possibly come; and God will give the feeling in such a measure and at such a time as His love sees best for the individual case.

</p>

<p>We must choose between facing toward our feelings and facing toward God's facts. Our feelings may be as uncertain as the sea or the shifting sands. God's facts are as certain as the Rock of Ages, even Christ Himself, who is the same yesterday, today and forever.

</p>

<p><em>"When darkness veils His lovely face<br /> I rest on His unchanging grace;<br /> In every high and stormy gale,<br /> My anchor holds within the veil."</em>
