</p>

<p>We have wonderful teaching here on prayer, and we are shown the direct hindrance from Satan.

</p>

<p>Daniel had fasted and prayed twenty-one days, and had a very hard time in prayer. As far as we read the narrative, it was not because Daniel was not a good man, nor because his prayer was not right; but it was because of a special attack of Satan.

</p>

<p>The Lord started a messenger to tell Daniel that his prayer was answered the moment Daniel began to pray; but an evil angel met the good angel and wrestled with him, hindering him. There was a conflict in the heavens; and Daniel seemed to go through an agony on earth the same as that which was going on in the heavens.

</p>

<p>"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers… against wicked spirits in high places" (Eph. 6:12, margin).

</p>

<p>Satan delayed the answer three full weeks. Daniel nearly succumbed, and Satan would have been glad to kill him; but God will not suffer anything to come above that we "are able to bear."

</p>

<p>Many a Christian's prayer is hindered by Satan; but you need not fear when your prayers and faith pile up; for after a while they will be like a flood, and will not only sweep the answer through, but will also bring some new accompanying blessing.<br /> <em>--Sermon</em>

</p>

<p>Hell does its worst with the saints. The rarest souls have been tested with high pressures and temperatures, but Heaven will not desert them.<br /> <em>--W. L. Watkinson</em>
