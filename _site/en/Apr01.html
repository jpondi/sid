        <p><em>Though he slay me, yet will I trust him </em>(Job 13:15).


</p>

<p><em>For I know whom I have believed</em> (2 Tim. 1:12).


</p>

<p><em>I will not doubt, though all my ships at sea</em><br /> <em><em>Come drifting home with broken masts and
            sails;</em><br /> <em>I will believe the Hand which never fails,</em><br /> <em>From seeming evil worketh
            good for me.</em><br /> <em>And though I weep because those sails are tattered,</em><br /> <em>Still will I
            cry, while my best hopes lie shattered:</em><br /> <em>'I trust in Thee.'</em></em>


</p>

<p><em>I will not doubt, though all my prayers return</em><br /> <em><em>Unanswered from the still, white realm
            above;</em><br /> <em>I will believe it is an all-wise love</em><br /> <em>Which has refused these things
            for which I yearn;</em><br /> <em>And though at times I cannot keep from grieving,</em><br /> <em>Yet the
            pure ardor of my fixed believing</em><br /> <em>Undimmed shall burn.</em></em>


</p>

<p><em>I will not doubt, though sorrows fall like rain,</em><br /> <em><em>And troubles swarm like bees about a
            hive.</em><br /> <em>I will believe the heights for which I strive</em><br /> <em>Are only reached by
            anguish and by pain;</em><br /> <em>And though I groan and writhe beneath my crosses.</em><br /> <em>I yet
            shall see through my severest losses</em><br /> <em>The greater gain.</em></em>


</p>

<p><em>I will not doubt. Well anchored is this faith,</em><br /> <em><em>Like some staunch ship, my soul braves every
            gale;</em><br /> <em>So strong its courage that it will not quail</em><br /> <em>To breast the mighty
            unknown sea of death.</em><br /> <em>Oh, may I cry, though body parts with spirit,</em><br /> <em>'I do not
            doubt,' so listening worlds may hear it,</em><br /> <em>With my last breath.</em></em>


</p>

<p>"In fierce storms," said an old seaman, "we must do one thing; there is only one way: we must put the ship in a
    certain position and keep her there." This, Christian, is what you must do.



</p>

<p>Sometimes, like Paul, you can see neither sun nor stars, and no small tempest lies on you; and then you can do but
    one thing; there is only one way. Reason cannot help you; past experiences give you no light. Even prayer fetches no consolation. Only a single course is left.
    You must put your soul in one position and keep it there.


</p>

<p>You must stay upon the Lord; and come what may--winds, waves, cross-seas, thunder, lightning, frowning rocks, roaring
    breakers--no matter what, you must lash yourself to the helm, and hold fast your confidence in God's faithfulness,
    His covenant engagement, His everlasting love in Christ Jesus.<br /> <em>--Richard Fuller</em>
