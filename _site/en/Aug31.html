        <p><em>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed</em> (John 20:29).

</p>

<p>How strong is the snare of the things that are seen, and how necessary for God to keep us in the things that axe unseen! If Peter is to walk on the water he must walk; if he is going to swim, he must swim, but he cannot do both. If the bird is going to fly it must keep away from fences and the trees, and trust to its buoyant wings. But if it tries to keep within easy reach of the ground, it will make poor work of flying.

</p>

<p>God had to bring Abraham to the end of his own strength, and to let him see that in his own body he could do nothing. He had to consider his own body as good as dead, and then take God for the whole work; and when he looked away from himself, and trusted God alone, then he became fully persuaded that what He had promised, He was able to perform.

</p>

<p>That is what God is teaching us, and He has to keep away encouraging results until we learn to trust without them, and then He loves to make His Word real in fact as well as faith.<br /> <em>--A. B. Simpson</em>

</p>

<p><em>I do not ask that He must prove<br /> His Word is true to me,<br /> And that before I can believe<br /> He first must let me see.<br /> It is enough for me to know<br /> 'Tis true because He says 'tis so;<br /> On His unchanging Word I'll stand</em><br /> <em>And trust till I can understand.</em><br /> --E. M. Winter
