        <p><em>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his inner being shall flow rivers of living water</em> (John 7:38).

</p>

<p>Some of us are shivering and wondering why the Holy Spirit does not fill us. We have plenty coming in, but we do not give it out. Give out the blessing that you have, start larger plans for service and blessing, and you will soon find that the Holy Ghost is before you, and He will present you with blessings for service, and give you all that He can trust you to give away to others.

</p>

<p>There is a beautiful fact in nature which has its spiritual parallels. There is no music so heavenly as an Aeolian harp, and the Aeolian harp is nothing but a set of musical chords arranged in harmony, and then left to be touched by the unseen fingers of the wandering winds. And as the breath of heaven floats over the chords, it is said that notes almost Divine float out upon the air, as if a choir of angels were wandering around and touching the strings.

</p>

<p>And so it is possible to keep our hearts so open to the touch of the Holy Spirit that He can play upon them at will, as we quietly wait in the pathway of His service.<br /> <em>--Days of Heaven upon Earth</em>

</p>

<p>When the apostles received the baptism with the Holy Ghost they did not rent the upper room and stay there to hold holiness meetings, but went everywhere preaching the gospel.<br /> <em>--Will Huff</em>

<p><em>"If I have eaten my morsel alone,"<br /> The patriarch spoke with scorn;<br /> What would he think of the Church were he shown<br /> Heathendom-huge, forlorn,<br /> Godless, Christless, with soul unfed,<br /> While the Church's ailment is fullness of bread,<br /> Eating her morsel alone?<br /> "Freely ye have received, so give,"<br /> He bade, who hath given us all.<br /> How shall the soul in us longer live<br /> Deaf to their starving call,<br /> For whom the blood of the Lord was shed,<br /> And His body broken to give them. bread,<br /> If we eat our morsel alone!"</em><br /> --Archbishop Alexander
