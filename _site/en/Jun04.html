        <p><em>The Lord caused the sea to go back all that night</em> (Exod. 14:21).

</p>

<p>In this verse there is a comforting message showing how God works in the dark. The real work of God for the children of Israel, was not when they awakened and found that they could get over the Red Sea; but it was “all that night.”

</p>

<p>So there may be a great working in your life when it all seems dark and you cannot see or trace, but yet God is working. Just as truly did He work “all that night,” as all the next day. The next day simply manifested what God had done during the night. Is there anyone reading these lines who may have gotten to a place where it seems dark?

</p>

<p>You believe to see, but you are not seeing. In your life-progress there is not constant victory; the daily, undisturbed communion is not there, and all seems dark.

</p>

<p>“The Lord caused the sea to go back all that night.” Do not forget that it was “all that night.” God works all the night, until the light comes. You may not see it, but all that “night” in your life, as you believe God, He works. 

</p>

<p><em>-–C. H. P.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“All that night” the Lord was working,<br /> Working in the tempest blast,<br /> Working with the swelling current,<br /> Flooding, flowing, free and fast.<br /> “All that night” God’s children waited–<br /> Hearts, perhaps in agony With the enemy behind them,<br /> And, in front, the cruel sea.<br /> “All that night” seemed blacker darkness<br /> Than they ever saw before,<br /> Though the light of God’s own presence<br /> Near them was, and sheltered o’er.<br /> “All that night” that weary vigil<br /> Passed; the day at last did break,<br /> And they saw that God was working<br /> “All that night” a path to make.<br /> “All that night,” O child of sorrow,<br /> Canst thou not thy heartbreak stay?<br /> Know thy God in darkest midnight</em><br /> <em>Works, as well as in the day.</em><br /> –L. S. P.
