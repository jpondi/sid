        <p><em>Sarah bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him</em> (Gen. 21:2).

</p>

<p>The counsel of the Lord standeth forever, the thoughts of His heart to all generations" (Psalm 33:11). But we must be prepared to wait God's time. God has His set times. It is not for us to know them; indeed, we cannot know them; we must wait for them.

</p>

<p>If God had told Abraham in Haran that he must wait for thirty years until he pressed the promised child to his bosom, his heart would have failed him. So, in gracious love, the length of the weary years was hidden, and only as they were nearly spent, and there were only a few more months to wait, God told him that "according to the time of life, Sarah shall have a son." (Gen. 18:14).Â The set time came at last; and then the laughter that filled the patriarch's home made the aged pair forget the long and weary vigil.

</p>

<p>Take heart, waiting one, thou waitest for One who cannot disappoint thee; and who will not be five minutes behind the appointed moment: ere long "your sorrow shall be turned into joy."

</p>

<p>Ah, happy soul, when God makes thee laugh! Then sorrow and crying shall flee away forever, as darkness before the dawn.<br /> <em>--Selected</em>

</p>

<p>It is not for us who are passengers, to meddle with the chart and with the compass. Let that all-skilled Pilot alone with His own work.<br /> <em>--Hall</em>

</p>

<p>"Some things cannot be done in a day. God does not make a sunset glory in a moment, but for days may be massing the mist out of which He builds His palaces beautiful in the west."

</p>

<p><em>Some glorious morn--but when? Ah, who shall say?</em><br /> <em><em>The steepest mountain will become a plain,</em><br /> <em>And the parched land be satisfied with rain.</em><br /> <em>The gates of brass all broken; iron bars,</em><br /> <em>Transfigured, form a ladder to the stars.</em><br /> <em>Rough places plain, and crooked ways all straight,</em><br /> <em>For him who with a patient heart can wait.</em><br /> <em>These things shall be on God's appointed day:</em><br /> <em>It may not be tomorrow--yet it may.</em></em>
