<p><em>And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose,</em> (Rom 8:28)

</p>

<p>How wide is this assertion of the Apostle Paul! He does not say, “We know that some things,” or “most things,” or “joyous things,” but “ALL things.” From the minutest to the most momentous; from the humblest event in daily providence to the great crisis hours in grace.

</p>

<p>And all things "work’—they are working; not all things have worked, or shall work; but it is a present operation.

</p>

<p>At this very moment, when some voice may be saying, “Thy judgments are a great deep,” the angels above, who are watching the development of the great plan, are with folded wings exclaiming, “The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Ps. 145:17)

</p>

<p>And then all things “work together.” It is a beautiful blending. Many different colors, in themselves raw and unsightly, are required in order to weave the harmonious pattern.

</p>

<p>Many separate tones and notes of music, even discords and dissonances, are required to make up the harmonious anthem.

</p>

<p>Many separate wheels and joints are required to make the piece of machinery. Take a thread separately, or a note separately, or a wheel or a tooth of a wheel separately, and there may be neither use nor beauty discernible.

</p>

<p>But complete the web, combine the notes, put together the separate parts of steel and iron, and you see how perfect and symmetrical is the result. Here is the lesson for faith: “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.”<br /><em>—Macduff</em>

</p>

<p>In one thousand trials it is not five hundred of them that work for the believer’s good, but nine hundred and ninety-nine of them, and one beside.<br /><em>—George Mueller</em>

</p>

<p>“GOD MEANT IT UNTO GOOD” (Gen. 50:20).

</p>

<p><em>“God meant it unto good”—O blest assurance,</em><br /><em><em>Falling like sunshine all across life’s way,</em> <br /> <em>Touching with Heaven’s gold earth’s darkest storm clouds,</em> <br /> <em>Bringing fresh peace and comfort day by day.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>’Twas not by chance the hands of faithless brethren</em><br /><em><em>Sold Joseph captive to a foreign land;</em> <br /> <em>Nor was it chance which, after years of suffering,</em> <br /> <em>Brought him before the monarch’s throne to stand.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>One Eye all-seeing saw the need of thousands,</em><br /><em><em>And planned to meet it through that one lone soul;</em> <br /> <em>And through the weary days of prison bondage</em> <br /> <em>Was working towards the great and glorious goal.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>As yet the end was hidden from the captive,</em><br /><em><em>The iron entered even to his soul;</em> <br /> <em>His eye could scan the present path of sorrow,</em> <br /> <em>Not yet his gaze might rest upon the whole.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Faith failed not through those long, dark days of waiting,</em><br /><em><em>His trust in God was recompensed at last,</em> <br /> <em>The moment came when God led forth his servant</em> <br /> <em>To succour many, all his sufferings past.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>“It was not you but God, that sent me hither,”</em><br /><em><em>Witnessed triumphant faith in after days;</em> <br /> <em>“God meant it unto good,” no “second causes”</em> <br /> <em>Mingled their discord with his song of praise.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>“God means it unto good” for thee, beloved,</em><br /><em><em>The God of Joseph is the same today;</em> <br /> <em>His love permits afflictions strange and bitter,</em> <br /> <em>His hand is guiding through the unknown way.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>Thy Lord, who sees the end from the beginning,</em><br /><em><em>Hath purposes for thee of love untold.</em> <br /> <em>Then place thy hand in His and follow fearless,</em> <br /> <em>Till thou the riches of His grace behold.</em></em>

</p>

<p><em>There, when thou standest in the Home of Glory,</em><br /><em><em>And all life’s path ties open to thy gaze,</em> <br /> <em>Thine eyes shall see the hand which now thou trustest,</em> <br /> <em>And magnify His love through endless days.</em></em><br />—Freda Hanbury Allen
