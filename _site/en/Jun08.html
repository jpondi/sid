        <p><em>...because everyone who has been fathered by God conquers the world. This is the conquering power that has conquered the world: our faith</em>. (1 John 5:4)

</p>

<p>At every turn in the road one can find something that will rob him of his victory and peace of mind, if he permits it. Satan is a long way from having retired from the business of deluding and ruining God’s children if he can. At every milestone it is well to look carefully to the thermometer of one’s experience, to see whether the temperature is well up.

</p>

<p>Sometimes a person can, if he will, actually snatch victory from the very jaws of defeat, if he will resolutely put his faith up at just the right moment.

</p>

<p>Faith can change any situation. No matter how dark it is, no matter what the trouble may be, a quick lifting of the heart to God in a moment of real, actual faith in Him, will alter the situation in a moment.

</p>

<p>God is still on His throne, and He can turn defeat into victory in a second of time, if we really trust Him.

</p>

<p><em>“God is mighty! He is able to deliver;</em><br /> <em>Faith can victor be in every trying hour;</em><br /> <em>Fear and care and sin and sorrow be defeated</em><br /> <em>By our faith in God’s almighty, conquering power.</em>

</p>

<p><em>“Have faith in God, the sun will shine,</em><br /> <em>Though dark the clouds may be today;</em><br /> <em>His heart has planned your path and mine,</em><br /> <em>Have faith in God, have faith alway.”</em>

</p>

<p>“When one has faith, one does not retire; one stops the enemy where he finds him.”<br /> <em>—Marshal Foch</em>
