        <p><em>So he said, “Come.” Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”</em> (Matthew 14:29-30)

</p>

<p>Peter had a little faith in the midst of his doubts, says Bunyan; and so with crying and coming he was brought to Christ.

</p>

<p>But here you see that sight was a hindrance; the waves were none of his business when once he had set out; all Peter had any concern with, was the pathway of light that came gleaming across the darkness from where Christ stood. If it was tenfold Egypt beyond that, Peter had no call to look and see.

</p>

<p>When the Lord shall call to you over the waters, “Come,” step gladly forth. Look not for a moment away from Him.

</p>

<p>Not by measuring the waves can you prevail; not by gauging the wind will you grow strong; to scan the danger may be to fall before it; to pause at the difficulties, is to have them break above your head. Lift up your eyes unto the hills, and go forward—there is no other way.

</p>

<p><em>“Dost thou fear to launch away?<br /> Faith lets go to swim!<br /> Never will He let thee go;<br /> ’Tis by trusting thou shalt know<br /> Fellowship with Him."</em>

</p>
