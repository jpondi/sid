        <p><em>Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above</em>. John 19:11

</p>

<p>Nothing that is not God's will can come into the life of one who trusts and obeys God. This fact is enough to make our life one of ceaseless thanksgiving and joy. For "God's will is the one hopeful, glad, and glorious thing in the world"; and it is working in the omnipotence for us all the time, with nothing to prevent it if we are surrendered and believing.

</p>

<p>One who was passing through deep waters of affliction wrote to a friend:

</p>

<p>"Is it not a glorious thing to know that, no difference how unjust a thing may be, or how absolutely it may seem to be from Satan, by the time it reaches us it is God's will for us, and will work for good to us?

</p>

<p>For all things work together for good to us who love God. And even of the betrayal, Christ said, "The cup which my Father gave me, shall I not drink it?"

</p>

<p>We live charmed lives if we are living in the center of God's will. All the attacks that Satan, through others' sin, can hurl against us are not only powerless to harm us, but are turned into blessings on the way.<br /> --<em>H. W. S.</em>

</p>

<p><em>In the center of the circle<br /> Of the Will of God I stand:<br /> There can come no second causes,<br /> All must come from His dear hand.<br /> All is well! for 'tis my Father<br /> Who my life hath planned.<br /> Shall I pass through waves of sorrow?<br /> Then I know it will be best;<br /> Though I cannot tell the reason,<br /> I can trust, and so am blest.<br /> God is Love, and God is faithful,<br /> So in perfect Peace I rest.<br /> With the shade and with the sunshine,<br /> With the joy and with the pain,<br /> Lord, I trust Thee! both are needed,<br /> Each Thy wayward child to train,<br /> Earthly loss, did we but know it,<br /> Often means our heavenly gain.</em><br /> --I. G. W.
