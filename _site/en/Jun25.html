        <p><em>"Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward"</em> (Exod. 14:15).

</p>

<p>Imagine, O child of God, if you can, that triumphal march! The excited children restrained from ejaculations of wonder by the perpetual hush of their parents; the most uncontrollable excitement of the women as they found themselves suddenly saved from a fate worse than death; while the men followed or accompanied them ashamed or confounded that they had ever mistrusted God or murmured against Moses; and as you see those mighty walls of water piled by the outstretched hand of the Eternal, in response to the faith of a single man, learn what God will do for His own.

</p>

<p>Dread not any result of implicit obedience to His command; fear not the angry waters which, in their proud insolence, forbid your progress. Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, "the Lord sitteth King for ever."

</p>

<p>A storm is only as the outskirts of His robe, the symptom of His advent, the environment of His presence.

</p>

<p>Dare to trust Him; dare to follow Him! And discover that the very forces which barred your progress and threatened your life, at His bidding become the materials of which an avenue is made to liberty. <br /> --F. B. Meyer

</p>

<p><em>Have you come to the Red Sea place in your life,</em><br /> <em>Where, in spite of all you can do,</em><br /> <em>There is no way out, there is no way back,</em><br /> <em>There is no other way but through?</em><br /> <em>Then wait on the Lord with a trust serene</em><br /> <em>Till the night of your fear is gone;</em><br /> <em>He will send the wind,</em><br /> <em>He will heap the floods,</em><br /> <em>When He says to your soul, "Go on."</em><br /> <em>And His hand will lead you through—clear through--</em><br /> <em>Ere the watery walls roll down,</em><br /> <em>No foe can reach you, no wave can touch,</em><br /> <em>No mightiest sea can drown;</em><br /> <em>The tossing billows may rear their crests,</em><br /> <em>Their foam at your feet may break,</em><br /> <em>But over their bed you shall walk dry shod</em><br /> <em>In the path that your Lord will make.</em><br /> <em>In the morning watch, 'beneath the lifted cloud,</em><br /> <em>You shall see but the Lord alone,</em><br /> <em>When He leads you on from the place of the sea</em><br /> <em>To a land that you have not known;</em><br /> <em>And your fears shall pass as your foes have passed,</em><br /> <em>You shall be no more afraid;</em><br /> <em>You shall sing His praise in a better p</em>lace,<br /> <em>A place that His hand has made.</em><br /> --Annie Johnson Flint
