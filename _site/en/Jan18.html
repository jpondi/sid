        <p><em>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ (</em>2 Corinthians 2:14<em>).</em>

</p>

<p>God gets His greatest victories out of apparent defeats. Very often the enemy seems to triumph for a little, and God lets it be so; but then He comes in and upsets all the work of the enemy, overthrows the apparent victory, and as the Bible says, "turns the way of the wicked upside down." Thus He gives a great deal larger victory than we would have known if He had not allowed the enemy, seemingly, to triumph in the first place.

</p>

<p>The story of the three Hebrew children being cast into the fiery furnace is a familiar one. Here was an apparent victory for the enemy. It looked as if the servants of the living God were going to have a terrible defeat. We have all been in places where it seemed as though we were defeated, and the enemy rejoiced. We can imagine what a complete defeat this looked to be. They fell down into the flames, and their enemies watched them to see them burn up in that awful fire, but were greatly astonished to see them walking around in the fire enjoying themselves. Nebuchadnezzar told them to "come forth out of the midst of the fire." Not even a hair was singed, nor was the smell of fire on their garments, "because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort."

</p>

<p>This apparent defeat resulted in a marvelous victory.

</p>

<p>Suppose that these three men had lost their faith and courage, and had complained, saying, "Why did not God keep us out of the furnace!" They would have been burned, and God would not have been glorified. If there is a great trial in your life today, do not own it as a defeat, but continue, by faith, to claim the victory through Him who is able to make you more than conqueror, and a glorious victory will soon be apparent. Let us learn that in all the hard places God brings us into, He is making opportunities for us to exercise such faith in Him as will bring about blessed results and greatly glorify His name.<br /> <em>--Life of Praise</em>

</p>

<p><em>Defeat may serve as well as victory<br /> To shake the soul and let the glory out.<br /> When the great oak is straining in the wind,<br /> The boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk<br /> Sends down a deeper root on the windward side.<br /> Only the soul that knows the mighty grief<br /> Can know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come<br /> To stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.</em>
