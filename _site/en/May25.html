        <p><em>So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory</em>. (2 Tim 2:10)

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>If Job could have known as he sat there in the ashes, bruising his heart on this problem of Providence—that in the trouble that had come upon him he was doing what one man may do to work out the problem for the world, he might again have taken courage. No man lives to himself. Job’s life is but your life and mine written in larger text….So, then, though we may not know what trials wait on any of us, we can believe that, as the days in which Job wrestled with his dark maladies are the only days that make him worth remembrance, and but for which his name had never been written in the book of life, so the days through which we struggle, finding no way, but never losing the light, will be the most significant we are called to live.<br /> <em>—Robert Collyer</em>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Who does not know that our most sorrowful days have been amongst our best? When the face is wreathed in smiles and we trip lightly over meadows bespangled with spring flowers, the heart is often running to waste.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>The soul which is always blithe and gay misses the deepest life. It has its reward, and it is satisfied to its measure, though that measure is a very scanty one. But the heart is dwarfed; and the nature, which is capable of the highest heights, the deepest depths, is undeveloped; and life presently burns down to its socket without having known the resonance of the deepest chords of joy.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>“Blessed are they that mourn.” Stars shine brightest in the long dark night of winter. The gentians show their fairest bloom amid almost inaccessible heights of snow and ice.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>God’s promises seem to wait for the pressure of pain to trample out their richest juice as in a wine-press. Only those who have sorrowed know how tender is the “Man of Sorrows.”<br /> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Thou hast but little sunshine, but thy long glooms are wisely appointed thee; for perhaps a stretch of summer weather would have made thee as a parched land and barren wilderness. Thy Lord knows best, and He has the clouds and the sun at His disposal.<br /> <em>—Selected</em>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>“It is a gray day.” “Yes, but dinna ye see the patch of blue?”<br /> <em>—Scotch Shoemaker</em>
