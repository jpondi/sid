        <p><em>When it rises up, the mighty are terrified, at its thrashing about they withdraw.</em> (Job 41:25)

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>God uses most for His glory those people and things which are most perfectly broken. The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts. It was the breaking down of Jacob’s natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power. It was breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb, by the stroke of Moses’ rod that let out the cool waters to thirsty people.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It was when the 300 elect soldiers under Gideon broke their pitchers, a type of breaking themselves, that the hidden lights shone forth to the consternation of their adversaries. It was when the poor widow broke the seal of the little pot of oil, and poured it forth, that God multiplied it to pay her debts and supply means of support.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It was when Esther risked her life and broke through the rigid etiquette of a heathen court, that she obtained favor to rescue her people from death. It was when Jesus took the five loaves and broke them, that the bread was multiplied in the very act of breaking, sufficient to feed five thousand. It was when Mary broke her beautiful alabaster box, rendering it henceforth useless, that the pent-up perfume filled the house. It was when Jesus allowed His precious body to be broken to pieces by thorns and nails and spear, that His inner life was poured out, like a crystal ocean, for thirsty sinners to drink and live.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by DEATH, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains. And thus, on and on, through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual life, God must have BROKEN THINGS.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Those who are broken in wealth, and broken in self-will, and broken in their ambitions, and broken in their beautiful ideals, and broken in worldly reputation, and broken in their affections, and broken ofttimes in health; those who are despised and seem utterly forlorn and helpless, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon, and using for God’s glory. “The lame take the prey,” Isaiah tells us.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><em>O break my heart; but break it as a field </em>

</p>

<p><em>Is by the plough up-broken for the corn;</em>

</p>

<p><em>O break it as the buds, by green leaf seated, </em>

</p>

<p><em>Are, to unloose the golden blossom, torn;</em>

</p>

<p><em>Love would I offer unto Love’s great Master,</em>

</p>

<p><em>Set free the odor, break the alabaster.</em>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><em>O break my heart; break it victorious God, </em>

</p>

<p><em>That life’s eternal well may flash abroad;</em>

</p>

<p><em>O let it break as when the captive trees, </em>

</p>

<p><em>Breaking cold bonds, regain their liberties;</em>

</p>

<p><em>And as thought’s sacred grove to life is springing,</em>

</p>

<p><em>Be joys, like birds, their hope, Thy victory singing.</em><br /> —Thomas Toke Bunch
