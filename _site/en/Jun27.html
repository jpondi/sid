        <p><em>The Lord hath sent strength for thee</em> (Ps.68.28, PBV).

</p>

<p>The Lord imparts unto us that primary strength of character which makes everything in life work with intensity and decision. We are "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man." And the strength is continuous; reserves of power come to us which we cannot exhaust.

</p>

<p>"As thy days, so shall thy strength be"—strength of will, strength of affection, strength of judgment, strength of ideals and achievement.

</p>

<p>"The Lord is my strength" <em>to go on</em>. He gives us power to tread the dead level, to walk the long lane that seems never to have a turning, to go through those long reaches of life which afford no pleasant surprise, and which depress the spirits in the sameness of a terrible drudgery.

</p>

<p>"The Lord is my strength" <em>to go up</em>. He is to me the power by which I can climb the Hill Difficulty and not be afraid.

</p>

<p>"The Lord is my strength" <em>to go down</em>. It is when we leave the bracing heights, where the wind and the sun have been about us, and when we begin to come down the hill into closer and more sultry spheres, that the heart is apt to grow faint. I heard a man say the other day concerning his growing physical frailty, "It is the coming down that tires me!"

</p>

<p>"The Lord is my strength" <em>to sit still</em>. And how difficult is the attainment! Do we not often say to one another, in seasons when we are compelled to be quiet, "If only I could do something!"

</p>

<p>When the child is ill, and the mother stands by in comparative impotence, how severe is the test! But to do nothing, just to sit still and wait, requires tremendous strength.

</p>

<p>"The Lord is my strength!" "Our sufficiency is of God" (2 Cor. 3:5. <em>from The Silver Lining</em>
