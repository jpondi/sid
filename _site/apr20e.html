            "üïäÔ∏è Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts üïäÔ∏è"<br>
            (Zechariah 4:6)
        </div>

        <p>üëâ <span class="highlight">I was walking up a hill when I saw a boy riding his bicycle.</span> He was pedaling hard against the wind, struggling to go up. It looked very difficult for him. Just then, a trolley car came by going the same way - up the hill.</p>

        <p>The trolley wasn't too fast, so the boy grabbed hold of the back bar with one hand. <span class="highlight">Suddenly, he went up the hill easily, like he was flying!</span> Then I realized:</p>

        <p>"This is just like me! <span class="highlight">I'm like that boy on the bicycle</span> - tired and weak, struggling against problems, almost giving up. But Jesus' strength is right here for me, like that trolley car.</p>

        <p>I just need to <span class="highlight">stay connected to Him</span>, even if my faith feels as small as one little finger. That's enough to make His power mine for whatever seems too hard for me right now." This thought helped me feel less tired and remember this truth.</p>

            <p>Completely given to the Holy Spirit!<br>
            Wanting all He gives, no matter what it takes;<br>
            Letting go of safety, moving into<br>
            His great power - strong to save and keep.</p>
            
            <p>Completely given to the Holy Spirit!<br>
            Oh! The letting go, until I disappear!<br>
            Until my empty life lies broken before Him;<br>
            Waiting for His filling to finish His work.</p>
            
            <p>Completely given to God's will;<br>
            Wanting only the path Jesus walked;<br>
            Leaving comfort and fun, choosing Him instead,<br>
            Waiting for His direction, listening for His voice.</p>
            
            <p>Completely given up! No plans of my own;<br>
            For now and forever, only His way;<br>
            All my ideas lost in His perfect will,<br>
            Having nothing, yet having everything in Him.</p>
            
            <p>Completely given up! Such sweet peace<br>
            Held by His love, yet completely free;<br>
            Free from sin's traps, free from fear,<br>
            Free from every worry, problem, or sadness.</p>
            
            <p>Completely given up! Oh, the rest is sweet,<br>
            As I wait at Jesus' feet;<br>
            Waiting for the Holy Spirit to come,<br>
            Who will make me completely clean inside.</p>
            
            <p>Look! He comes and fills me, Sweet Holy Spirit!<br>
            In Him, I'm full! In Him, I'm whole!<br>
            The light in my soul will never grow dim<br>
            While I keep my promise - given completely to Him!</p>
