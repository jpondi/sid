            "🙌 And being absolutely certain that whatever promise He is bound by, He is able to make good 🙌"<br>
            (Romans 4:20)
        </div>

        <p>👉 <span class="highlight">The Bible tells us Abraham could look at his own old body (which was as good as dead) without feeling discouraged.</span> Why? Because he wasn't looking at himself - he was looking at Almighty God!</p>

        <p>Abraham didn't doubt God's promise. <span class="highlight">He stood strong under the weight of God's blessings.</span> Instead of getting weaker, his faith grew stronger when things looked impossible. He praised God, being <span class="highlight">completely sure</span> that God who made the promise was not just able, but <span class="highlight">more than able</span> (the Greek words mean God has unlimited power and endless resources) to do what He said.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Our God has no limits to what He can do.</span> The only limits are the ones we put on Him. <span class="highlight">Our prayers are too small. Our dreams are too small. Our faith is too small.</span> God wants to lift us up to think bigger and expect more from Him. Will we disappoint Him by thinking small?</p>

        <p>There's <span class="highlight">no limit</span> to what we can ask from our great God El-Shaddai (the All-Sufficient One)! There's only one measure for how much He will bless us: <span class="highlight">"according to the power that works in us."</span></p>
