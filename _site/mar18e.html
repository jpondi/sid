        <h1>Streams in the Desert - March 18 🌿📖✨</h1>

        <p><span class="highlight">He answered nothing</span> (Mark 15:3). 🙏🤐</p>

        <p>There is no scene in the Bible more powerful than the silent Savior, who didn’t say a word to those who were accusing Him. 🕊️🤍 He could have stopped them with just one look or word, but He chose to stay silent. 🤫✨ He let them do their worst, standing in <span class="bold">THE POWER OF STILLNESS</span>—God’s holy, silent Lamb. 🐑💖</p>

        <p>There is a kind of stillness that lets God work for us. 🙏🌌 It’s a stillness that stops us from trying to fix everything ourselves, from defending ourselves, or from planning every detail. 🛑🤯 Instead, it trusts God to handle the situation with His perfect love. 💖🙌</p>

        <p>Often, we miss God’s help because we try to fight our own battles. ⚔️😔 Let’s ask God for this <span class="italic">silent power</span> and a spirit that trusts Him completely. 🙏🕊️ When life’s struggles are over, people will remember us like they remember the calm morning dew, 🌅💧 the gentle sunlight, ☀️🌿 the evening breeze, 🌬️🌙 the Lamb of Calvary, 🐑✝️ and the peaceful, holy Dove. 🕊️✨</p>

        <p>-- A. B. Simpson</p>

        <p class="italic">The day when Jesus stood alone 🙍‍♂️🌄<br>
        And felt the hearts of men like stone, 🪨💔<br>
        And knew He came but to atone ✝️💖<br>
        That day "He held His peace." 🤐🕊️<br>
        They witnessed falsely to His word, 🗣️❌📖<br>
        They bound Him with a cruel cord, 🔗😢<br>
        And mockingly proclaimed Him Lord; 👑🤡<br>
        "But Jesus held His peace." 🤐🕊️<br>
        They spat upon Him in the face, 🤮👤<br>
        They dragged Him on from place to place, 🚶‍♂️➡️🚶‍♂️<br>
        They heaped upon Him all disgrace; 🗑️😔<br>
        "But Jesus held His peace." 🤐🕊️<br>
        My friend, have you for far much less, 🤔👫<br>
        With rage, which you called righteousness, 😡⚖️<br>
        Resented slights with great distress? 😤😩<br>
        Your Saviour "held His peace." 🤐🕊️<br>
        -- L. S. P.</p>

        <p>I remember hearing Bishop Whipple, known as <span class="bold">"The Apostle of the Indians,"</span> say: <span class="italic">"For thirty years, I’ve tried to see the face of Christ in those I disagreed with."</span> 🌟👳‍♂️🙏</p>

        <p>When we have this attitude, we’ll avoid being narrow-minded or too quick to judge. 🚫🧠⚡ We’ll also avoid anger and anything that could harm our testimony for Jesus, who came not to destroy lives but to save them. 💕✝️🙌</p>

        <p>-- W. H. Griffith Thomas</p>
