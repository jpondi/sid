    <p>✨ <em>"Though he slay me, yet will I trust him"</em> (Job 13:15). 🌟</p>
    <p>✨ <em>"For I know whom I have believed"</em> (2 Timothy 1:12). 🌟</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>I <span class="highlight">will not doubt</span>, though all my ships at sea<br>
    Come home broken with torn sails and masts; 🚢⚓<br>
    I believe the <span class="highlight">Hand which never fails</span>,<br>
    Works good for me even from bad things. 🙌</p>
    
    <p>I <span class="highlight">will not doubt</span>, though all my prayers seem<br>
    Unanswered from heaven's quiet space; 🌌<br>
    I believe it's <span class="highlight">wise love</span> that says no<br>
    To things I deeply want. Though my heart aches,<br>
    My faith will keep burning bright. 🔥</p>
    
    <p>I <span class="highlight">will not doubt</span>, though troubles come<br>
    Like pouring rain or swarming bees; 🌧️🐝<br>
    I believe the <span class="highlight">best things in life</span><br>
    Come through struggle and pain. Though I hurt now,<br>
    I will see how my losses become gains. 💎</p>
    
    <p>I <span class="highlight">will not doubt</span>. My faith stands firm<br>
    Like a strong ship in every storm; ⛵🌪️<br>
    So brave it can face even death's dark sea.<br>
    With my last breath, may the world hear me cry:<br>
    <span class="highlight">"I do not doubt!"</span> 🌅</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>🌊 <span class="highlight">"In bad storms,"</span> said an old sailor, <em>"we must do one thing - just one way: point the ship right and keep her steady."</em> Christian, this is what you must do too. 🌊</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes like Paul, you can't see sun or stars, and the storm won't stop. 🌩️ Then you have just <span class="highlight">one choice</span>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 <em>Reason</em> can't help you</li>
    <li>🕯️ <em>Past experiences</em> give no light</li>
    <li>🙏 <em>Prayer</em> brings no comfort</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>There's only <span class="highlight">one way</span>: <em>Hold on to the Lord</em>. No matter what comes - wind, waves, lightning, rocks - ⚡🌊 you must <span class="highlight">tie yourself to God</span> and keep trusting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🤝 His <em>faithfulness</em></li>
    <li>📜 His <em>promises</em></li>
    <li>❤️ His <em>never-ending love in Jesus</em></li>
  </ul>
