<h1>🌪️ <strong>Storms - Streams in the Desert - March 31</strong> 🌪️</h1>

<p>The wind was <strong>against them</strong> (<em>Matthew 14:24</em>).</p>

<p>🌬️ <strong>March winds</strong> are loud and wild. Aren’t they like the <em>hard times</em> in my life? But really, I should be <strong>thankful</strong> for these storms. 🌧️</p>

<p>It’s <em>better</em> to face rain and floods than to stay in a <em>perfect, easy place</em> where nothing ever changes. Storms of <strong>temptation</strong> seem cruel, but don’t they make me <strong>pray harder</strong>? Don’t they force me to <strong>hold onto God’s promises tighter</strong>? Don’t they make me <em>stronger</em> in the end? 💪</p>

<p>Storms of <strong>loss</strong> hurt deeply. But they also <em>push me closer to God</em>. In the quiet of His presence, He speaks <strong>softly</strong> to my heart. ❤️ There’s a <strong>beauty in Jesus</strong> that we only see when the <em>winds are against us</em> and the waves toss us around. 🌊</p>

<div class="quote">
    ✝️ <strong>Jesus doesn’t promise calm seas—He promises safe arrival.</strong> He doesn’t stop the storm, but He <em>protects us through it</em>. ✝️

<div class="poem">
    <p>Oh, set your sail to the heavenly gale,</p>
    <p>And then, no matter what winds prevail,</p>
    <p>No reef can wreck you, no calm delay;</p>
    <p>No mist shall hinder, no storm shall stay;</p>
    <p>Though far you wander and long you roam</p>
    <p>Through salt sea sprays and o'er white sea foam,</p>
    <p>No wind that can blow but shall speed you Home.</p>
    <p>—<em>Annie Johnson Flint</em> 🏡</p>
