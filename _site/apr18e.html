        <h1>🌵 Streams in the Desert - April 18 🌵</h1>
        
        <div class="verse">"And he shall bring it to pass" (Ps. 37:5) 🙏</div>
        
        <p>I used to think that after praying, I needed to do <span class="highlight">everything possible</span> to make the answer happen. But God showed me a better way! 🤗 He taught me that when I try too hard in my own strength, it actually <span class="highlight">stops Him from working</span>. Now when I pray and truly believe God for something, I wait with a thankful heart ❤️ and only do what He tells me to do.</p>
        
        <p>It feels <span class="highlight">scary</span> to just sit still and <span class="highlight">trust God completely</span>! 😅 The temptation to take control ourselves is very strong. But remember:</p>
        
        <p>👉 If a drowning person keeps struggling, the rescuer <span class="highlight">can't save them</span>. 🌊</p>
        <p>👉 In the same way, God <span class="highlight">can't fight</span> our battles when we <span class="highlight">keep fighting</span> in our own strength. </p>
        <p>It's not that He <span class="highlight">won't</span> help - He <span class="highlight">can't</span> help when we don't let Him! 🙌</p>
        
        <p class="point">Spiritual forces cannot work while earthly forces are active. ⚡</p>
        
        <p>🌷 <span class="highlight">God needs time to answer prayer.</span> We often forget to give Him that time! 🌷</p>
        
        <p>Think about this:</p>
        <p>🌸 God takes time to paint a beautiful rose</p>
        <p>🌳 God takes time to grow a mighty oak tree</p>
        <p>🍞 God takes time to make bread from wheat fields</p>
        
        <p>First He prepares the earth...<br>
        Then He softens it...<br>
        Then He makes it rich...<br>
        He sends rain and dew... 💦<br>
        He warms it with sunlight... ☀️<br>
        Then comes the green shoot...<br>
        Then the stalk...<br>
        Then the golden grain...<br>
        And finally, bread for hungry people! 🍞</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">All of this takes time!</span> ⏳</p>
        
        <p>That's why we:<br>
        🌱 Plant seeds<br>
        👩‍🌾 Work the soil<br>
        ⏳ Wait patiently<br>
        🙏 Trust God<br>
        ...until His perfect plan is complete! ✔️</p>
        
        <p>We must learn this same lesson about prayer! 💖 God needs time to answer our prayers - just like He needs time to make a rose, an oak tree, or a loaf of bread. </p>
        
        <p>So let's:<br>
        ✨ Pray with faith<br>
        🌈 Wait with patience<br>
        🌟 Trust His timing<br>
        Because our God <span class="highlight">always keeps His promises!</span> 🙌</p>
