        <p class="verse">"All these things are against me" (Genesis 42:36) ✝️<br>
        "All things work together for good to them that love God" (Romans 8:28) 🙏</p>
        
        <p>Many people want <span class="highlight">power</span>. But how do we get power? ⚡ The other day we saw a power plant where electric trains get their energy. We heard the loud noise of many wheels turning. We asked, <span class="highlight">"How does this make power?"</span> 🔌</p>
        
        <p>Our friend explained: <span class="highlight">"The wheels rubbing together create electricity. The friction makes the power."</span> 🔥</p>
        
        <p>It's the same with God. When He wants to give you more spiritual power, He allows pressure in your life. 💪 <span class="highlight">The hard times create spiritual strength through friction.</span> Some people try to run from problems instead of using them to grow stronger. 🏃‍♂️</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Challenges are necessary for balance.</span> 🌎 The Earth stays in orbit because two forces work against each other - one pushing forward, one holding back. Without this balance, our planet would fly off into empty space. 🚀</p>
        
        <p>God guides our lives the same way. We need <span class="highlight">both pushing and holding back forces</span>. He uses life's tests, temptations, and things that seem against us to actually move us forward on the right path. 🛤️</p>
        
        <p>Let's thank God for <span class="highlight">both the easy and hard times</span>. Let's accept the weights along with the wings. With God's help, let's keep going forward with faith and patience toward our heavenly calling. ✨</p>

        <p>In a factory, many machines work together: <br>
        ⚙️ Wheels turn fast and slow<br>
        🔧 Some push while others pull<br>
        🔊 Some are loud, some are quiet<br>
        🤹 It looks like chaos, but everything has a purpose<br>
        👨‍🔧 From the biggest lever to the smallest part<br>
        🤲 All work together as planned<br>
        🧠 A wise mind controls it all<br>
        ✋ A strong hand guides everything</p>
        
        <p>This is how God works for His people: <br>
        🌪️ Some things might seem bad alone<br>
        🛑 Some might appear to block us<br>
        ↩️ Some might seem to pull us back<br>
        🤝 But together, they work for good<br>
        😔 Our disappointments<br>
        ❌ Our unmet desires<br>
        ❓ Things we don't understand<br>
        ✋ Are all held in our Father's loving hand</p>
