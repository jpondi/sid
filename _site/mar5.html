    <h1>🌿 Streams in the Desert - March 5 🌿</h1>

    <p class="verse">✨ For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end (Heb 3:14). ✨</p>

    <p>🔥 <span class="highlight">It is the last step that wins;</span> and there is no place in the pilgrim’s progress where so many dangers lurk as the region that lies hard by the portals of the Celestial City. 🏰</p>

    <p>⚠️ It was there that <span class="highlight">Doubting Castle</span> stood. It was there that the enchanted ground lured the tired traveler to fatal slumber. 💤</p>

    <p>🌟 It is when Heaven’s heights are full in view that hell’s gate is most persistent and full of deadly peril. 💀</p>

    <blockquote>💡 <span class="highlight">“Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.”</span> 🌱</blockquote>

    <blockquote>🏃‍♂️ <span class="highlight">“So run, that ye may obtain.”</span> 🏅</blockquote>

    <div class="poem">
        <p>🌊 In the bitter waves of woe</p>
        <p>💨 Beaten and tossed about</p>
        <p>🌪 By the sullen winds that blow</p>
        <p>🌫 From the desolate shores of doubt,</p>
        <p>⚓ Where the anchors that faith has cast</p>
        <p>🌪 Are dragging in the gale,</p>
        <p>🤲 I am quietly holding fast</p>
        <p>💖 To the things that cannot fail.</p>

        <br>

        <p>⚔️ And fierce though the fiends may fight,</p>
        <p>🙈 And long though the angels hide,</p>
        <p>🌍 I know that truth and right</p>
        <p>⚖️ Have the universe on their side;</p>
        <p>✨ And that somewhere beyond the stars</p>
        <p>💖 Is a love that is better than fate.</p>
        <p>🌌 When the night unlocks her bars</p>
        <p>👀 I shall see Him—and I will wait.</p>
        <p class="note">—Washington Gladden</p>
    </div>

    <p>📢 <span class="highlight">The problem of getting great things from God is being able to hold on for the last half hour.</span> ⏳</p>
