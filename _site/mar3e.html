    <p class="verse">📖 <span class="highlight">"And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him"</span> (Mark 9:26).</p>
    
    <p>👿 <span class="highlight">Evil never surrenders its hold without a sore fight.</span> We never pass into any spiritual inheritance through the delightful exercises of a picnic 🎉, but always through the grim contentions of the battlefield ⚔️.</p>
    
    <p>🙏 It is so in the secret realm of the soul. Every faculty which wins its spiritual freedom does so at the price of <span class="highlight">blood 🩸</span>. Apollyon is not put to flight by a courteous request; he straddles across the full breadth of the way, and our progress has to be registered in <span class="highlight">blood and tears 😢</span>.</p>
    
    <p>🔥 <span class="highlight">This we must remember</span> or we shall add to all the other burdens of life the gall of misinterpretation. We are not "born again" into soft and protected nurseries 🏠, but in the open country 🌿 where we suck strength from the very terror of the tempest 🌩️.</p>
    
    <p>💪 <span class="highlight">"We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."</span></p>
    
    <h2>🎵 Faith of our Fathers 🎵</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Faith of our Fathers! living still,</strong><br>
    In spite of dungeon, fire 🔥 and sword ⚔️:<br>
    O how our hearts beat high with joy 😊<br>
    Whene'er we hear that glorious word 📜.</p>
    
    <p class="highlight">Faith of our Fathers! Holy Faith!<br>
    We will be true to Thee till death! ☦️</p>
    
    <p><strong>Our fathers, chained in prisons dark ⛓️,</strong><br>
    Were still in heart and conscience free 🕊️;<br>
    How sweet would be their children's fate,<br>
    If they, like them, could die for Thee! 🙏</p>
