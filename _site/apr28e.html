    <h1>🦸 God Prepares Heroes - Streams in the Desert - April 28 ⚔️</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"When the Israelites cried out to the Lord, He raised up Othniel to rescue them. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he defeated their enemies." ✝️ (Judges 3:9-10)</div>
        
        <p>🛡️ <span class="highlight">God is preparing His heroes right now.</span> When the moment comes, He can place them perfectly in position instantly - and the world will marvel where they came from!</p>

        <p>✨ Let the Holy Spirit prepare you, friend, through life's challenges. When the final polish is done on the marble sculpture, God can easily place it on display for all to see.</p>

        <p>👑 A day is coming when, like Othniel, we'll help judge nations and reign with Christ. But first, <span class="highlight">God must prepare us through life's trials and small victories</span> - their full meaning hidden for now. Rest assured: when the Holy Spirit has an Othniel ready, Heaven has a throne prepared!</p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>🌞 "Human strength and greatness true<br>
            🌊 Come not from life's easy view,<br>
            🦸 Heroes can't be driftwood light<br>
            🌊 Floating on seas calm and bright."</p>
            
            <p>🛣️ "Every life's road dips down low,<br>
            🚇 Through tunnels dark we all must go,<br>
            🏔️ Before we reach the heights above<br>
            🎉 And walk in triumph's light and love."</p>
