            <span class="highlight">Beloved, do not be surprised at the ordeal that has come to test you…</span> you are sharing what Christ suffered; so <span class="emphasize">rejoice in it</span> (1 Peter 4:12-13). 🙏✨

            Many a waiting hour was needed to enrich the harp of David, and many a waiting hour in the wilderness will gather for us a psalm of <span class="emphasize">"thanksgiving, and the voice of melody,"</span> to cheer the hearts of fainting ones here below, and to make glad our Father's house on high. �🎶

            What was the preparation of the son of Jesse for the songs like unto which none other have ever sounded on this earth? The outrage of the wicked, which brought forth cries for God's help. Then the faint hope in God's goodness blossomed into a song of rejoicing for His mighty deliverances and manifold mercies. Every sorrow was another string to his harp; every deliverance another theme for praise. 🎻🙌

            One thrill of anguish spared, one blessing unmarked or unprized, one difficulty or danger evaded, how great would have been our loss in that thrilling Psalmody in which God's people today find the expression of their grief or praise! 😢🎵

            To wait for God, and to suffer His will, is to know Him in the fellowship of His sufferings, and to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. So now, if the vessel is to be enlarged for spiritual understanding, <span class="highlight">be not afraid of the wider sphere of suffering that awaits you.</span> The Divine capacity of sympathy will have a more extended sphere, for the breathing of the Holy Spirit in the new creation never made a stoic, but left the heart's affection tender and true. 💖🕊️
