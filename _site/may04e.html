        <p>When we walk below mountains that have been shaken by earthquakes and torn apart, we see something beautiful. After destruction comes <span class="highlight">perfect peace</span>.</p>
        
        <p>💧 Clear pools form beneath fallen rocks, water lilies shine, and reeds whisper in the shadows.</p>
        
        <p>🏡 Villages rebuild over forgotten graves, and white church towers stand tall, showing God's protection - <span class="highlight">"in whose hand are all the corners of the earth, and the strength of the hills is his also."</span></p>

            <p>God ploughed one day with an earthquake,<br>
            And drove His furrows deep!<br>
            The plains jumped up in fear,<br>
            The hills began to leap!</p>
            
            <p>But mountains hold a secret,<br>
            Hidden in their chest;<br>
            <span class="highlight">"God's peace is everlasting,"</span><br>
            Is their quiet rest.</p>
            
            <p>🌄 He made them homes of beauty,<br>
            🌅 Where His grace would stay;<br>
            He covers them with morning light,<br>
            And sunsets end their day.</p>
            
            <p>🌪️ His winds bring storm messages,<br>
            🌊 News from the wild sea;<br>
            They sing it through the valleys<br>
            💧 In the rain's sweet melody.</p>
            
            <p>🏞️ They nurse the baby rivers,<br>
            ☁️ Feed His flying clouds;<br>
            They shelter newborn races,<br>
            Strong, free, and proud.</p>
            
            <p>🏙️ People from tired cities<br>
            🙏 Come pray at mountain shrines;<br>
            God makes them fresh again<br>
            As He passes by all day.</p>
            
            <p>✨ Now I know their secret!<br>
            The beauty deep and true!<br>
            When hard times come and shake us,<br>
            And sorrows break through -</p>
            
            <p>🌾 It's just God ploughing mountains;<br>
            And these mountains yet will be<br>
            The source of His grace and freshness,<br>
            And His <span class="highlight">everlasting peace</span> for me.</p>
