    <h1>🌹 Streams in the Desert - April 25 ✝️</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre" ✝️ (Matt. 27:61)</div>
        
        <p>How strange grief is - it doesn't learn, doesn't know, and doesn't want to. 😔 When the mourning women sat by the tomb, did they see the 2,000 years of triumph ahead? Did they see anything but: <span class="highlight">"Our Christ is gone!"</span></p>

        <p>Yet from their loss came <span class="highlight">our Christ</span>! Countless grieving hearts have found resurrection in their sorrow. But the mourners only saw death - not that this was preparing for Christ's coronation! 🤴 His silence meant He would rise with tenfold power.</p>

        <p>They didn't see it. They cried 😢, left, then returned to the tomb - still just a dark, silent grave.</p>

        <p>We're the same. At first, we all sit by our "garden tombs" saying: <span class="highlight">"This pain can't be fixed! I see no good in it! I refuse comfort!"</span> Yet often, right in our worst troubles, Christ waits to rise again. ✨</p>

        <p>Where death seems final, our Savior appears. 🕊️ Where hope ends, new life begins. 🌱 In the darkest night, eternal light dawns. ☀️ Later, we see tombs don't ruin gardens - they make the flowers brighter.</p>

        <p>Our joys grow deeper when sorrow waters them. 💧 And sorrow shines when surrounded by God's planted joys. The flowers might not be our favorites - but they're heart-flowers: 💖 <span class="highlight">love, hope, faith, joy, peace</span> - blooming around every grave in a Christian's heart.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>🌹 Christ walked sorrow's path so drear<br>
            ✝️ To enter into rest;<br>
            Should I seek roses blooming here?<br>
            🌎 Or think earth's truly blessed?</p>
            
            <p>🌸 Heaven's purest lilies grow<br>
            👑 From earth's most painful woe.<br>
            Who bears their cross with patience here<br>
            🟪 Shall wear king's purple there.</p>
