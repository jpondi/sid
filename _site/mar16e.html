<h1>Streams in the Desert - March 16</h1>

<p><span class="verse">For our profit</span> (Hebrews 12:10).</p>

<p>In one of Ralph Connor's books, he tells a story about <span class="highlight">Gwen</span>. Gwen was a wild, willful girl who always got her way. One day, she had a terrible accident that left her crippled for life. She became very angry and bitter. During this hard time, she was visited by the <span class="emphasize">Sky Pilot</span>, a missionary who worked among the mountain people. He told her a story called the <span class="highlight">Parable of the Canyon</span>.</p>

<p>🌄 <span class="emphasize">"At first, there were no canyons, only wide, open prairies. One day, the Master of the Prairie walked over his land and asked, 'Where are your flowers?' The Prairie replied, 'Master, I have no seeds.'</span></p>

<p>🐦 <span class="emphasize">Then the Master spoke to the birds, and they carried seeds of every kind of flower and scattered them everywhere. Soon, the prairie was filled with beautiful flowers like crocuses, roses, buffalo beans, yellow crowfoot, wild sunflowers, and red lilies. The Master was pleased, but He missed His favorite flowers. He asked, 'Where are the clematis, columbine, sweet violets, wind-flowers, ferns, and flowering shrubs?'</span></p>

<p>⚡ <span class="emphasize">Again, the birds scattered seeds, but the Master still couldn't find His favorite flowers. The Prairie cried, 'Oh, Master, I cannot keep these flowers. The winds are too strong, and the sun is too hot. They wither and fly away.'</span></p>

<p>🌊 <span class="emphasize">Then the Master called upon the Lightning. With one powerful strike, the Lightning split the Prairie open, creating a deep canyon. The Prairie groaned in pain, but over time, the river flowed through the canyon, bringing rich soil. The birds scattered seeds again, and soon, the canyon was filled with beautiful flowers like clematis, columbine, violets, and wind-flowers. Great trees grew, and the canyon became the Master's favorite place of rest, peace, and joy."</span></p>

<p>📖 The Sky Pilot then read to Gwen: <span class="verse">"The fruit—I'll read 'flowers'—of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness. Some of these flowers grow only in the canyon."</span></p>

<p>🌸 Gwen asked softly, <span class="emphasize">"Which are the canyon flowers?"</span> The Sky Pilot replied, <span class="emphasize">"Patience, gentleness, and meekness. Though love, joy, and peace can grow in the open, they bloom more beautifully and smell sweeter in the canyon."</span></p>

<p>💔 Gwen lay still for a while, then said sadly, <span class="emphasize">"There are no flowers in my canyon, only rough rocks."</span> The Sky Pilot comforted her, <span class="emphasize">"Some day, Gwen dear, the Master will find them, and we will see them too."</span></p>

<p>🌟 <span class="highlight">Beloved, when you face your canyon, remember this story. The Master is at work, even in the hardest times. Your canyon will bloom with beautiful flowers in His time.</span> 🌸</p>
