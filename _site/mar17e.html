    <h1>Streams in the Desert - March 17 🌵📖</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p><span class="highlight">"Be thou there till I bring thee word"</span> (Matthew 2:13). 🙏</p>
        
        <p>I'll stay where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>; <br>
        I will, dear Lord, though I wanted so badly to go. 🚶‍♂️💨 <br>
        I was eager to march with the <span class="emphasize">'rank and file,'</span> 🥁🎶 <br>
        Yes, I wanted to lead them, You know. 👑🌟 <br>
        I planned to keep step to the music loud, 🎵🔥 <br>
        To cheer when the banner unfurled, 🎉🏳️ <br>
        To stand in the midst of the fight, straight and proud, ⚔️🛡️ <br>
        But I'll stay where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>. 🛑🙌</p>

        <p>I'll stay where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>; I'll work, dear Lord, 👷‍♂️❤️ <br>
        Though the field be narrow and small, 🌾📏 <br>
        And the ground be fallow, and the stones lie thick, 🪨🌱 <br>
        And there seems to be no life at all. 🏜️💀 <br>
        The field is <span class="emphasize">Thine own</span>, only give me the seed, 🌱🙏 <br>
        I'll sow it with never a fear; 🌟😌 <br>
        I'll till the dry soil while I wait for the rain, 🌧️⏳ <br>
        And rejoice when the green blades appear; 🌿🎉 <br>
        I'll work where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>. 💪🌾</p>

        <p>I'll stay where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>; I will, dear Lord; 🙏❤️ <br>
        I'll bear the day's burden and heat, 🌞🔥 <br>
        Always trusting Thee fully; when evening has come 🌙✨ <br>
        I'll lay heavy sheaves at Thy feet. 🌾👣 <br>
        And then, when my earth work is ended and done, 🕰️✅ <br>
        In the light of eternity's glow, 🌟🌈 <br>
        Life's record all closed, I surely shall find 📖🔍 <br>
        It was better to stay than to go; 🛑 > 🚶‍♂️ <br>
        I'll stay where <span class="emphasize">You've put me</span>. 🙌🏠</p>

        <p>Oh restless heart, that beats against your prison bars of circumstances, ❤️⛓️ <br>
        Yearning for a wider sphere of usefulness, 🌍🚀 <br>
        Leave God to order all your days. 🙏📅 <br>
        <span class="highlight">Patience and trust</span>, in the dullness of the routine of life, ⏳🤍 <br>
        Will be the best preparation for a courageous bearing 💪🛡️ <br>
        Of the tug and strain of the larger opportunity 🌟💼 <br>
        Which God may someday send you. 🌈🙌✨</p>
