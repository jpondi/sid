    <h1>✨ Streams in the Desert - April 27 ✝️</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <div class="verse">"I am the living one! I was dead, but now I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave." ✝️ (Revelation 1:18)</div>
        
        <p>🌸 Easter lilies! Speak to me again this morning your eternal lesson of life after death - the comfort you've brought to so many grieving hearts.</p>

        <p>📖 Wise old Bible! Let me read again your sure promise that "to die is gain."</p>

        <p>✍️ Poets! Recite your verses that echo the Gospel of everlasting life in every line.</p>

        <p>🎶 Singers! Burst forth with joyful songs - let me hear those familiar resurrection hymns once more!</p>

        <p>🌳 Trees, flowers, birds, sea, sky and wind - whisper it, sing it, echo it! Let every atom pulse with this truth until the air vibrates with it!</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Tell it again and again until hope becomes certainty, and certainty becomes unshakable knowledge.</span> Until we, like Paul, can face death with triumph, unwavering faith, and shining faces.</p>

        <div class="poem">
            <p>😔 O grieving ones who walk where cypress grows,<br>
            ⚰️ Among the graves where loved ones find repose,<br>
            ☀️ Lift up your eyes to heaven's endless blue -<br>
            ✝️ For Christ has made all things forever new!</p>
            
            <p>🌸 No time for sadness - weave bright Easter flowers,<br>
            🔔 Let joyful bells chase away sorrow's hours,<br>
            ❤️ Feel your soul stir with resurrection's power,<br>
            🎶 As Easter songs ring out this glorious hour!</p>
            
            <p>⛓️ If Christ still lay locked in death's prison cell,<br>
            😢 Then bitter tears would be appropriate still.<br>
            ✨ But He has risen! Death could not prevail!<br>
            🎉 So dry your tears - let joy your heart regale!</p>
        </div>

        <p>✝️ A pastor writing his Easter sermon suddenly realized: <span class="highlight">"Christ is ALIVE right now! His grave is empty - He's not the great 'I was' but the great 'I AM'!"</span> He jumped up excitedly, pacing as the truth overwhelmed him. Easter's glorious reality!</p>

        <p>🌸 We believe every grave grows an Easter lily. 👼 Every tomb has an angel. We serve a <span class="highlight">living Lord</span>! Don't just look back worshiping at His grave - look up to worship the Christ who lives! And because He lives, we too shall live forever!</p>
