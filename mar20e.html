<h1>🌟 Grieving Yet Rejoicing - Streams in the Desert - March 20 🌟</h1>

<p><span class="emoji">😢</span> <span class="italic">As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing</span> <span class="verse">(2 Cor. 6:10)</span>.</p>

<p>The stoic scorns to shed a tear; the Christian is not forbidden to weep. <span class="emoji">💧</span> The soul may be dumb with excessive grief, as the shearer's scissors pass over the quivering flesh; or, when the heart is on the point of breaking beneath the meeting surges of trial, the sufferer may seek relief by crying out with a loud voice. <span class="emoji">📢</span> But there is something even better. <span class="emoji">✨</span></p>

<p>They say that springs of sweet fresh water well up amid the brine of salt seas; <span class="emoji">🌊💧</span> that the fairest Alpine flowers bloom in the wildest and most rugged mountain passes; <span class="emoji">🏔️🌸</span> that the noblest psalms were the outcome of the profoundest agony of soul. <span class="emoji">🎶</span></p>

<p>Be it so. And thus amid manifold trials, souls which love God will find reasons for bounding, leaping joy. <span class="emoji">💃🕺</span> Though deep call to deep, yet the Lord's song will be heard in silver cadence through the night. <span class="emoji">🌌🎵</span> And it is possible in the darkest hour that ever swept a human life to bless the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="emoji">🙏</span></p>

<p>Have you learned this lesson yet? Not simply to endure God's will, nor only to choose it; but to rejoice in it with joy unspeakable and full of glory. <span class="emoji">🎉</span></p>
<p class="highlight">--Tried as by Fire <span class="emoji">🔥</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p>I will be still, my bruised heart faintly murmured, <span class="emoji">💔</span><br>
As o'er me rolled a crushing load of woe; <span class="emoji">🏋️‍♂️</span><br>
The cry, the call, e'en the low moan was stifled; <span class="emoji">🤐</span><br>
I pressed my lips; I barred the tear drop's flow. <span class="emoji">💧</span><br>
I will be still, although I cannot see it, <span class="emoji">👀</span><br>
The love that bares a soul and fans pain's fire; <span class="emoji">🔥</span><br>
That takes away the last sweet drop of solace, <span class="emoji">🍯</span><br>
Breaks the lone harp string, hides Thy precious lyre. <span class="emoji">🎻</span><br>
But God is love, so I will bide me, bide me-- <span class="emoji">❤️</span><br>
We'll doubt not, Soul, we will be very still; <span class="emoji">🤫</span><br>
We'll wait till after while, when He shall lift us <span class="emoji">⏳</span><br>
Yes, after while, when it shall be His will. <span class="emoji">🙌</span><br>
And I did listen to my heart's brave promise; <span class="emoji">👂</span><br>
And I did quiver, struggling to be still; <span class="emoji">💪</span><br>
And I did lift my tearless eyes to Heaven, <span class="emoji">👁️</span><br>
Repeating ever, "Yea, Christ, have Thy will." <span class="emoji">🙏</span><br>
But soon my heart upspake from 'neath our burden, <span class="emoji">💬</span><br>
Reproved my tight-drawn lips, my visage sad: <span class="emoji">😔</span><br>
"We can do more than this, O Soul," it whispered. <span class="emoji">🗣️</span><br>
"We can be more than still, we can be glad!" <span class="emoji">😊</span><br>
And now my heart and I are sweetly singing-- <span class="emoji">🎶</span><br>
Singing without the sound of tuneful strings; <span class="emoji">🎵</span><br>
Drinking abundant waters in the desert, <span class="emoji">🏜️💧</span><br>
Crushed, and yet soaring as on eagle's wings. <span class="emoji">🦅</span><br>
