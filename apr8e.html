<h1>🌵 Streams in the Desert - April 8 🌻</h1>

<div class="devotional">
    <p class="verse">"<em>So I am happy when I am weak, when people insult me, when I have needs, when people make it hard for me, and when troubles come. All these things are for Christ. Because when I am weak, then I am <span class="highlight">strong</span>.</em>" (2 Corinthians 12:10)</p>

    <p>✨ The real meaning of this Bible verse is even more powerful when we read it directly from the original language. It actually says: <span class="highlight">"So I am happy when I have no strength, when people say mean things, when I'm in trouble, when people chase me, when I'm stuck in hard places - all for Christ. Because when I have no strength, then I become like <em>dynamite</em>!"</span> 💥</p>

    <p>🙏 This is God's great secret - when we come to the end of our own strength and our situation seems impossible. When we get to this place, we'll stop complaining about our hard life or how people treat us badly. Instead, we'll see these problems as the very things God uses to bless us! We'll turn to Him and discover that these difficulties actually give us the right to ask for His help. 🔑</p>

        <p>— <span class="highlight">A.B. Simpson</span> 🌿</p>
    </div>

    <p>👨🦯 <span class="highlight">George Matheson</span>, the famous blind preacher from Scotland who recently went to heaven, once prayed: <em>"My God, I have never thanked You for my thorn. I've thanked You a thousand times for my roses, but never once for my thorn. I've been waiting for heaven where I'll be rewarded for my cross, but I never thought my cross itself could be a gift of glory.</em></p>

    <p><em>Teach me how my cross is glorious. Teach me why my thorn is valuable. Show me that my pain was the path that brought me to You. Show me that my tears created my rainbows."</em> 🌈</p>
