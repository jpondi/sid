<h1>🌿 Developing Grace - Streams in the Desert - April 10 🌿</h1>

<p><span class="verse">"<b>Show me why you are fighting with me</b>" (Job 10:2).</span></p>

<p>✨ <span class="highlight">Dear struggling friend</span>, maybe God is allowing this hard time to <b>help your good qualities grow</b>. Some of your best qualities would <i>never</i> be seen without difficulties! ✨</p>

<p>🌦️ <b>Your faith</b> doesn't shine as bright in easy times as it does in hard times. <b>Love</b> is like a glowworm - it shows its light best in darkness. <b>Hope</b> is like a star - you can't see it during the day, only at night! 💫</p>

<p>💎 <span class="highlight">Hard times are like the dark velvet that makes diamonds sparkle</span>. God uses struggles to make your good qualities shine brighter! 💎</p>

<p>🙏 Remember when you prayed: <i>"Lord, I'm afraid I don't have enough faith - please show me that I do"</i>? Without realizing it, you were actually asking for <b>trials</b>! How else can you know you have faith unless it gets tested? 🧗‍♂️</p>

<p>⚔️ God <i>often sends challenges</i> so:<br>
1️⃣ We can <b>discover</b> our strengths<br>
2️⃣ We can <b>be sure</b> they're really there<br>
3️⃣ We can <b>grow</b> even stronger! ⚔️</p>

<p>🎖️ God doesn't train His soldiers by letting them relax in comfortable tents. He makes them:<br>
- 🏞️ Cross dangerous rivers<br>
- ⛰️ Climb steep mountains<br>
- 🚶 Walk long, tiring miles with heavy packs 🎖️</p>

<p>💭 <span class="highlight">So Christian, could this be why you're facing troubles now?</span> Could this be why God is allowing this struggle in your life? 💭</p>
