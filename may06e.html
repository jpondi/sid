            <i>"God shares His secrets with those who respect Him"</i> <br>
            (Psalm 25:14).

            <b>God has special plans that His children can understand. 😇</b> Sometimes, the way God works in our lives might look scary or confusing from the outside. But faith looks deeper and says: <span class="highlight">"This is God's secret plan. You only see the surface - I see the hidden meaning."</span> ✨

            💎 Sometimes valuable diamonds come in plain wrapping so no one knows their worth. When the Tabernacle was built in the desert, it didn't look special from outside. All the beautiful things were hidden inside, covered by plain animal skins. 🏕️
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <span class="highlight">Dear friend,</span> God might send you precious gifts wrapped in plain paper. 🙌 Don't worry if the wrapping looks ordinary! Inside are treasures of <b>love</b>, <b>kindness</b>, and <b>wisdom</b>. If we accept what God gives and trust His goodness - even when it's hard to understand - we'll learn His secret plans. 🔑

            The loom must first stop working,<br>
            The shuttle cease to fly,<br>
            Before God shows the pattern<br>
            And tells us the reason why.<br><br>
            
            The dark threads are as needed<br>
            In the Weaver's perfect plan,<br>
            As threads of gold and silver<br>
            In the cloth made by His hand. �

            👑 <b>When Christ controls your life, you can handle any situation.</b> Are you feeling squeezed by problems? Don't run away! It's God's hand shaping you. 💪 You won't win by fighting circumstances, but by learning from them. God isn't just making you better - He's showing you how strong you really are! 💎
