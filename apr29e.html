    <h1>Streams in the Desert - April 29</h1>
</div>

<div class="verse">
    <b>"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are"</b> (James 5:17). 🙏
</div>

<p>Thank God for that! 🌈 Elijah hid under a juniper tree, just like we sometimes hide from problems. 😔 He complained and doubted, just like we often do. But everything changed when he truly connected with God. ✨</p>

<div class="point">
    <b>🔹 Even though Elijah was "a man like us," the Bible says "he prayed praying."</b> 
</div>

<p><span class="highlight">👉 This means he didn't just pray once - he kept on praying!</span> 🙏⏳</p>

<p>Climb up Mount Carmel with me 🏔️ and see this amazing lesson about <b>Faith vs Sight</b>. Elijah didn't need fire from heaven now - he needed rain! ☔ The same man who called down fire could call down rain using the same method: <b>persistent prayer</b>.</p>

<div class="quote">
    <b>"He bowed to the ground with his face between his knees"</b> - this means he blocked out all distractions. 🙈
</div>

<p>He told his servant: <b>"Go look toward the sea."</b> The servant returned and said just one word: <b>"Nothing!"</b> 🌊</p>

<p><span class="highlight">👉 What would we do in this situation?</span> 🤔</p>

<p>We might say: <b>"I knew this would happen!"</b> and stop praying. ❌ But Elijah? He said: <b>"Go again."</b> 🔄 The servant returned: <b>"Nothing!"</b> Elijah: <b>"Go again."</b> <b>"Nothing!"</b></p>

<p>Finally, the servant returned saying: <b>"I see a small cloud, as small as a man's hand."</b> ☁️ Soon, heavy rain fell! 🌧️ King Ahab couldn't even race back to Samaria fast enough with his chariot! 🐎</p>

<div class="point">
    <b>🔺 This story shows the difference between Faith and Sight:</b>
</div>

<p><span class="highlight">👉 Faith stays focused on God 🙏</span><br>
<span class="highlight">👉 Sight sees only problems 👀</span><br>
<span class="highlight">👉 Faith keeps praying even when things look hopeless ⏳</span></p>

<p><b>Do you know how to pray like this?</b> 💪 How to pray until something happens? Even when everything looks bad, don't focus on that. Your living God is still in heaven! 🌟 Sometimes delays are part of His perfect plan. ⏳❤️</p>

<div class="point">
    <b>🔺 Three boys explained what faith means:</b>
</div>

<ol>
    <li>The first said: <b>"Taking hold of Christ"</b> 👦✝️</li>
    <li>The second: <b>"Keeping hold"</b> 👧🤲</li>
    <li>The third: <b>"Not letting go"</b> 👶💪</li>
</ol>

<div class="blessing">
    God's blessings be with you! ✝️🙌
