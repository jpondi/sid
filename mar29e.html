<h1>🌿 Consider the Lilies - Streams in the Desert - March 29 🌼</h1>

<div class="verse">
    <p><em>"Consider the lilies, how they grow"</em> (Matthew 6:28) 🌱</p>
</div>

<div class="story">
    <p>"<span class="highlight">I need oil</span>," said an ancient monk 🧙‍♂️; so he planted an olive sapling 🌱. "<span class="highlight">Lord</span>," he prayed 🙏, "<span class="highlight">it needs rain that its tender roots may drink and swell. Send gentle showers</span>." And the Lord sent gentle showers 🌧️. "<span class="highlight">Lord</span>," prayed the monk, "<span class="highlight">my tree needs sun. Send sun, I pray Thee</span>." And the sun shone ☀️, gilding the dripping clouds. "<span class="highlight">Now frost, my Lord, to brace its tissues</span>," cried the monk. And behold, the little tree stood sparkling with frost ❄️, but at evening it died 💀.</p>

    <p>Then the monk sought the cell of a brother monk, and told his strange experience. "<span class="highlight">I, too, planted a little tree</span>," he said, "<span class="highlight">and see! it thrives well</span> 🌿. But I entrust my tree to its God. He who made it knows better what it needs than a man like me. I laid no condition. I fixed not ways or means. '<span class="highlight">Lord, send what it needs</span>,' I prayed, '<span class="highlight">storm or sunshine, wind, rain, or frost. Thou hast made it and Thou dost know</span>.'"</p>
</div>

<div class="poem">
    <p>Yes, leave it with Him 🤲<br>
    The lilies all do 🌷,<br>
    And they grow—<br>
    They grow in the rain 🌧️,<br>
    And they grow in the dew 💦—<br>
    Yes, they grow 🌱:</p>

    <p>They grow in the darkness 🌑, all hid in the night—<br>
    They grow in the sunshine ☀️, revealed by the light—<br>
    Still they grow 🌿.</p>

    <p>Yes, leave it with Him 🙌<br>
    'Tis more dear to His heart 💖,<br>
    You will know,<br>
    Than the lilies that bloom 🌸,<br>
    Or the flowers that start<br>
    'Neath the snow ❄️:</p>

    <p>Whatever you need, if you seek it in prayer 🙏,<br>
    You can leave it with Him—for you are His care.<br>
    You, you know 🤍.</p>
    <p>—Selected</p>
