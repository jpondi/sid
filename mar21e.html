    <h1>Streams in the Desert - March 21 🌿🌞</h1>

    <p><span class="highlight">According to your faith be it unto you</span> (Matthew 9:29). 🙏✨</p>

    <p><span class="emphasize">"Praying through"</span> means praying until you fully believe, and while you are still praying, you become sure that God has heard you. You start to feel like you have already received what you asked for, even before it happens. 💪🔥 <span class="emoji-large">🙌</span></p>

    <p>Remember, no situation on earth can stop God's Word from coming true if we focus on His unchanging Word and not on the unstable world around us. 🌍🚫 God wants us to trust His Word without needing any other proof. Then, He will give us <span class="highlight">"according to our faith."</span> 🌟🌈</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>When once His Word is past,<br>
        When He hath said, <span class="emphasize">'I will,'</span> (Hebrews 13:5) 🌟<br>
        The thing shall come at last;<br>
        God keeps His promise still. (2 Corinthians 1:20) 🌈✨</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prayer">
        <p>The prayer of the Pentecostal age was like a <span class="highlight">check</span> that could be cashed immediately. 💵💳 --Sir R. Anderson</p>
    </div>

    <p><span class="emphasize">"And God said… and it was so."</span> (Genesis 1:9) 🌌🌠</p>

    <p>Let us hold onto His promises with unwavering faith! 🌟🙏 <span class="emoji-large">💖</span></p>
