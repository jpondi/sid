    <h1>The Key of the Winds - Streams in the Desert - May 2</h1>
</div>

<div class="verse">
    <b>"The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all"</b> (Ps. 103:19). 👑✨
</div>

<p>One spring morning, as I left my house 🏡, a harsh east wind 💨 suddenly blew around the corner—fierce, cold, and full of dust. 😣 As I took my key 🔑 from the door, I muttered impatiently: <i>"I wish the wind would—"</i> I meant to say <i>"change"</i>, but stopped mid-sentence.</p>

<p>As I walked 🚶‍♂️, this became a spiritual lesson. An angel 👼 appeared holding a key: <b>"My Master sends His love and gives you this."</b> <i>"What is it?"</i> I asked. <b>"The key of the winds,"</b> he replied, then vanished.</p>

<p>Thrilled 😊, I rushed to the mountain caves 🏔️ where winds originate. <b>"I'll stop this east wind from bothering us!"</b> I locked it away 🔐 and heard echoes in the hollows. <i>"There! No more east wind!"</i> I said triumphantly.</p>

<p><i>"What wind should I choose instead?"</i> 🤔 I considered the pleasant south wind 🌬️—gentle for lambs 🐑 and spring flowers 🌸. But as I inserted the key, it burned my hand! 🔥 <b>"What am I doing?"</b> I cried. <i>"Who knows what damage I might cause? How do I know what the fields need?"</i> 😰</p>

<p>Ashamed 😔, I prayed 🙏 for the angel to take back the key—I'd never want it again! Then the Lord Himself ✝️ appeared. He took the key, and I noticed it touched His wound marks. ❤️ I regretted complaining about anything He allows.</p>

<p>He hung the key on His belt. <i>"You keep the key of the winds?"</i> I asked. <b>"I do, my child,"</b> He answered kindly. 😇 Looking closer, I saw <i>all</i> keys of my life there! 🔑</p>

<p><i>"Didn't you know My kingdom rules over all?"</i> He asked. <b>"Over all, Lord!"</b> I replied. <i>"Then... it's not safe for me to complain about anything?"</i></p>

<p>He touched me gently ✋: <b>"Your only safety is to love, trust, and praise Me in everything."</b> ❤️🙌</p>
