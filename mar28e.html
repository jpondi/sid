<h1>🌵✨ Streams in the Desert - March 28 ✨🌵</h1>

<p class="verse">🌊 "<i>And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap.</i>" (Joshua 3:13).</p>

<p>🔥🙌 <span class="highlight">Brave Levites! 🛑✋</span> Who wouldn’t admire them? They carried the Ark <b>🚶‍♂️💦 right into the river</b>—the waters didn’t part until their feet got wet! (v. 15). God hadn’t promised anything else. 🤯</p>

<p>✨⚡ <span class="highlight">God honors faith. 🙏</span> <b>"Obstinate faith"</b>—the kind that <i>👀 only looks at God’s promise</i> and nothing else. Imagine the people watching these holy men march forward. Some probably said, <i>"🤨 I wouldn’t take that risk! The Ark will be swept away! 🌊💨"</i> But no—<b>"the priests stood firm on dry ground. 🏜️🦶"</b> Faith helps God fulfill His plans. <i>"🆙 Come up to the help of the Lord."</i></p>

<p>💪🎯 The Ark had carrying poles for shoulders. Even the Ark didn’t move by itself—<i>🚶‍♂️💪 it had to be carried.</i> When God designs the work, <b>👷‍♂️👷‍♀️ people</b> are the builders. <span class="highlight">Faith works with God. 🤝</span> It can shut lions’ mouths 🦁🔇 and put out raging fires. 🔥🚫 It honors God, and <b>God honors it. 👑</b></p>

<p>🔥🙏 <i>Oh, for faith that keeps going 🚶‍♂️...</i>, trusting God to fulfill His promise <b>⏳ in His perfect time!</b> Fellow believers, let’s carry our load with joy—🎉 not like we’re carrying God’s coffin! ⚰️❌ <span class="highlight">This is the Ark of the living God! 🙌🔥</span> 🎶🎵 <i>Sing as you march toward the flood! 🌊🎤</i></p>

<p class="quote">—Thomas Champness ✍️</p>

<p>🌟⚡ <b>One special mark of the Holy Spirit in the early Church was <i>boldness. 💥</i></b> To do great things for God and expect great things from Him, we need <span class="highlight">holy audacity! 🦁🔥</span> When we trust a <i>🌌 supernatural God</i> for the impossible, it’s actually <b>📈 easier</b> to ask for big things than small ones. It’s easier to stand in daring faith than to cling timidly to safety. 🏖️😨</p>

<p>⚓🌊 <i>Like wise sailors in faith,</i> let’s launch into deep waters! 🚤🌊 We’ll discover: <b>With God, all things are possible. 💪✨</b> And <i>"all things are possible to those who believe. 🙏💫"</i></p>

<p>🚀🌈 <span class="highlight">Today, let’s attempt great things for God! 🌟</span> Take <b>His faith</b> to believe and <b>His strength</b> to achieve them. 💪🔥</p>
